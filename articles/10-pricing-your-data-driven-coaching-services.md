## Introduction

You've invested in medical-grade technology. You're delivering objective results. You're providing something most coaches can't.

**So why are you still charging the same as everyone else?**

Data-driven coaching isn't just better coaching—it's a fundamentally different service category. And different categories command different prices.

This guide covers exactly how to price your enhanced services: the psychology, the structures, the scripts, and the math that lets you charge what you're worth.

## The Pricing Psychology Shift

### The Old Equation

Traditional coaching pricing:

**Your Time × Hourly Rate = Price**

This caps your income at your available hours. Work more = earn more. Work less = earn less.

### The New Equation

Data-driven coaching pricing:

**Outcome Value + Tool Value + Expertise Value = Price**

This disconnects income from hours. Better outcomes = higher price. More valuable tools = higher price.

### Why Data Commands Premium

| Factor | Traditional Coaching | Data-Driven Coaching |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Basis for decisions | Subjective reports | Objective measurements |
| Proof of progress | "I feel better" | "Your HRV improved 47%" |
| Diagnosis speed | Weeks of trial and error | Days of data analysis |
| Confidence level | Educated guesses | Validated insights |
| Technology cost | Minimal | Significant investment |
| Expertise required | Standard | Specialized |

**Premium is justified. Now you need to claim it.**

## Market Positioning

### The Three Market Tiers

**Tier 1: Budget Coaching ($50-150/month)**
- Group programs
- Minimal personalization
- Template-based
- Self-guided with occasional check-ins
- No technology included

**Tier 2: Standard Coaching ($150-400/month)**
- Individual attention
- Personalized programming
- Regular check-ins
- May recommend consumer wearables
- Traditional coaching methods

**Tier 3: Premium Data-Driven Coaching ($400-1,000+/month)**
- Medical-grade biometric monitoring
- AI-powered insights
- Objective progress tracking
- Proactive intervention
- Comprehensive health picture

**Where do you want to play?**

Data-driven coaching naturally positions you in Tier 3. Pricing below this signals either:
- You don't believe in your value
- You don't know how to communicate it
- You're competing on the wrong factors

## Pricing Structures That Work

### Structure 1: All-Inclusive Monthly

**How it works:**
Single monthly fee includes everything—technology, coaching, and support.

**Example:**
- $597/month includes device, platform access, weekly check-ins, messaging

**Pros:**
- Simple for clients to understand
- No "surprise" technology costs
- Higher perceived value
- Better cash flow

**Cons:**
- Higher upfront commitment
- May deter price-sensitive prospects
- Device cost absorbed by you initially

**Best for:** Established coaches with proven results, clients who value simplicity

---

### Structure 2: Base + Technology

**How it works:**
Separate coaching fee from technology fee. Technology may be one-time or monthly.

**Example:**
- Coaching: $397/month
- Device: $299 one-time or $39/month

**Pros:**
- Lower perceived monthly commitment
- Client owns device (skin in game)
- Technology cost clearly separate
- Easier to compare coaching fee to market

**Cons:**
- More complex pricing conversation
- Two decision points instead of one
- Device purchase can be barrier

**Best for:** Coaches transitioning from traditional model, price-conscious markets

---

### Structure 3: Tiered Packages

**How it works:**
Multiple service levels with increasing technology and access.

**Example:**

| Tier | Monthly Fee | Includes |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Foundation | $297 | Basic tracking, monthly review, group access |
| Growth | $497 | Full biometrics, weekly review, direct messaging |
| Elite | $797 | All metrics, priority access, custom protocols |

**Pros:**
- Options for different budgets
- Natural upsell path
- Clients self-select
- Higher revenue potential

**Cons:**
- More complex to explain
- Choice paralysis possible
- Must deliver distinct value per tier

**Best for:** Coaches at scale, practices with varied client needs

---

### Structure 4: Commitment-Based Pricing

**How it works:**
Lower rates for longer commitments.

**Example:**
- Month-to-month: $597
- 3-month commitment: $497/month ($1,491 total)
- 6-month commitment: $447/month ($2,682 total)
- 12-month commitment: $397/month ($4,764 total)

**Pros:**
- Rewards commitment
- Improves cash flow predictability
- Reduces churn
- Matches results timeline (health takes months)

**Cons:**
- Lower per-month revenue
- Larger upfront commitment asks
- Refund policies needed

**Best for:** Coaches focused on retention, clients ready for transformation

## How to Calculate Your Rates

### The Value-Based Method

**Step 1: Identify outcome value**

What is the outcome worth to clients?

| Outcome | Value Indicators |
|---------|-----------------|
| Stress reduction | Medical costs avoided, productivity gained |
| Better sleep | Energy, focus, quality of life |
| Fitness improvement | Health span extension, vitality |
| Disease prevention | Future treatment costs avoided |
| Performance optimization | Career/athletic advancement |

**Step 2: Quantify if possible**

- Preventing one sick day = $200-500 in productivity
- Avoiding burnout = $10,000+ in career impact
- Better sleep = priceless quality of life
- 10% VO2max improvement = ~1-2 years of health span

**Step 3: Price at 10-20% of value**

If you help someone avoid burnout ($10,000+ cost), charging $500/month for 6 months ($3,000) is 30% of value—still a great deal for them.

### The Cost-Plus Method

**Step 1: Calculate your costs**

| Cost | Monthly |
|------|---------|
| Platform subscription | $100-300 |
| Device amortization | $15-30 |
| Your time (hours × rate) | $200-500 |
| Overhead allocation | $50-100 |
| **Total Cost** | **$365-930** |

**Step 2: Add profit margin**

Healthy margin: 40-60%

$500 cost × 1.5 = $750 minimum price

**Step 3: Validate against market**

Is $750 competitive for your market and positioning? Adjust if needed.

### The Competitive Method

**Step 1: Research competitors**

What do other data-driven coaches charge?

| Competitor Type | Typical Range |
|----------------|---------------|
| Local health coaches (traditional) | $150-350/month |
| Online coaches (traditional) | $100-300/month |
| Data-driven coaches | $400-800/month |
| Concierge health services | $500-2,000/month |
| Functional medicine + coaching | $800-1,500/month |

**Step 2: Position deliberately**

- Price at market = compete on other factors
- Price above market = must justify premium
- Price below market = leaves money on table (or signals lower quality)

**Step 3: Differentiate clearly**

What do you offer that justifies your position?

## The Pricing Conversation

### Script: Introducing Price

**Setup:** After discussing client goals, current situation, and how you can help.

**Transition:**
"Based on what you've shared, I believe I can help you achieve [specific outcome]. Let me explain how my approach works and what the investment looks like."

**The Approach:**
"My coaching is different from traditional approaches. I use medical-grade biometric monitoring that tracks 19+ vital signs continuously. This means I'm not guessing about what's happening with your health—I'm seeing it in real data.

You'll wear a device that monitors your heart rate variability, sleep stages, stress levels, recovery, and more. Through my platform, I see patterns that would be invisible otherwise, and I can adjust your program based on what's actually working—not just how you feel."

**The Investment:**
"The investment for this comprehensive approach is $[X] per month. That includes the monitoring technology, my ongoing analysis of your data, weekly check-ins, and direct access to me for questions.

Most clients see measurable improvement in their primary metrics within 30 days, and significant progress by 90 days."

**Pause. Let them respond.**

---

### Script: Handling "That's More Than I Expected"

**Acknowledge:**
"I understand. This is a significant investment."

**Reframe:**
"Let me share why it's priced at this level. Traditional coaching relies on what you tell me, which is limited by what you notice and remember. This approach gives me objective data—24 hours a day, 7 days a week—about what's actually happening in your body.

That means we can identify the real cause of issues in days instead of months. We can prove what's working instead of guessing. And we can catch problems before they become serious."

**Quantify:**
"If better sleep adds even 30 minutes of productive time to your day, that's 15+ hours per month. If reducing stress prevents one sick day per month, that's worth hundreds of dollars. The investment usually pays for itself within the first 60 days through better health outcomes."

**Options:**
"If the monthly commitment is challenging, I also offer [alternative tier/payment plan]. Would that work better for your situation?"

---

### Script: Handling "Other Coaches Charge Less"

**Acknowledge:**
"You're right—there are coaches who charge less."

**Differentiate:**
"The difference is in what you're getting. Most coaches offer conversation and accountability. I offer that plus continuous physiological monitoring, data analysis, and objective progress tracking.

It's the difference between a coach who asks 'how do you feel?' and one who can say 'your data shows your stress is elevated and your recovery is low—here's exactly what we need to adjust.'

That level of insight requires significant technology investment on my end, which is reflected in the pricing."

**Confidence:**
"If you're looking for traditional coaching, I can recommend some great colleagues. But if you want data-driven coaching with proven results, this is what that investment looks like."

## When to Raise Prices

### Signals You're Underpriced

- Full client roster with waitlist
- Closing rate above 80%
- No price objections ever
- Working more hours than desired
- Clients getting exceptional results

### How to Raise Prices

**For New Clients:**
Simply update your rates. No explanation needed.

**For Existing Clients:**
Give 30-60 days notice with explanation:

"Hi [Name],

I wanted to let you know about an upcoming change to my coaching investment.

Starting [date], my monthly rate will be [$X]. This reflects the continued investment in technology, training, and platform improvements that allow me to deliver better results.

As a valued current client, you have three options:
1. Continue at your current rate through [date + 90 days]
2. Lock in a 12-month commitment at your current rate
3. Transition to the new rate on [date]

Your progress has been incredible, and I'm committed to continuing our work together. Let me know which option works best for you.

[Your name]"

## Common Pricing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hourly Thinking

Pricing by the hour caps your earning potential and incentivizes working more, not better.

**Fix:** Price by outcome, package, or retainer—not hours.

### Mistake 2: Apologizing for Price

"It's $500, but I know that's a lot..." undermines your confidence and value.

**Fix:** State price confidently and stop talking. Let them respond.

### Mistake 3: Discounting Immediately

Offering discounts at first objection trains clients to negotiate and devalues your service.

**Fix:** Explore concerns before offering alternatives. Often it's not about money.

### Mistake 4: One Size Fits All

Same price for everyone misses revenue from those willing to pay more and excludes those who could pay less.

**Fix:** Tiered structure captures more market segments.

### Mistake 5: Hiding Technology Cost

If technology cost seems hidden in price, clients may feel deceived when they learn about it.

**Fix:** Be transparent about technology as part of value, not a secret add-on.
