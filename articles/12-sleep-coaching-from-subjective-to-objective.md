## Introduction

"How did you sleep?"
"Fine, I guess. About 7 hours."

This exchange happens in every coaching practice. And it's almost useless.

Here's why: humans are remarkably bad at perceiving their own sleep quality. Research shows people overestimate their sleep efficiency by 15-25% and misremember sleep duration by up to an hour.

That client who "slept fine for 7 hours" might have:
- Actually slept 5.8 hours (awake time forgotten)
- Only 25 minutes of deep sleep (should be 90+)
- Woken up 12 times (unremembered)
- SpO2 drops indicating sleep apnea (unperceivable)

**Objective sleep data changes everything.**

This guide shows you how to use sleep metrics to diagnose issues, design interventions, and prove improvements—transforming subjective "I feel tired" into actionable coaching.

## What Objective Sleep Tracking Reveals

### The Complete Sleep Picture

| Metric | What Subjective Reports Tell You | What Data Tells You |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Duration | "About 7 hours" | 6 hours 23 minutes exactly |
| Quality | "Pretty good" | 73% efficiency, 4 disruptions |
| Deep sleep | Nothing | 38 minutes (low) |
| REM sleep | Nothing | 62 minutes (low-normal) |
| Latency | "Fell asleep fast" | 28 minutes (elevated) |
| Breathing | Nothing | 12 respiratory events (concerning) |
| Heart rate | Nothing | Elevated through first half of night |

### The Perception Gap

**Study findings:**
- 95% of people can't accurately assess their sleep stages
- People with poor sleep often rate it as "good" (normalization)
- Perceived sleep duration has 0.4 correlation with actual (weak)
- Sleep disorders are undetected in 80% of cases without testing

**Coaching implication:** If you're coaching sleep based on self-report, you're coaching with incomplete—often inaccurate—information.

## The 6 Key Sleep Metrics for Coaches

### 1. Total Sleep Time (TST)

**What it measures:** Actual minutes asleep (excluding wake time)

**Healthy range:** 7-9 hours for most adults

**Coaching insights:**
- Less than 6 hours = significant deficit
- More than 9 hours consistently = possible depression or illness
- TST vs. time in bed = efficiency indicator

**Intervention triggers:**
- TST under 6 hours for 7+ days
- Significant discrepancy from perceived sleep

---

### 2. Sleep Efficiency

**What it measures:** Percentage of time in bed actually asleep

**Formula:** (Total sleep time / Time in bed) × 100

**Healthy range:** 85%+

**Coaching insights:**
- Under 75% = significant sleep maintenance issues
- High time in bed + low efficiency = sleep restriction candidate
- Low efficiency causes often identifiable in other metrics

**Intervention triggers:**
- Efficiency under 80% for 7+ days
- Declining trend in efficiency

---

### 3. Deep Sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep)

**What it measures:** Time in restorative, physically-recovering sleep stage

**Healthy range:** 1-2 hours (15-25% of total sleep)

**Why it matters:**
- Growth hormone release
- Physical tissue repair
- Immune system function
- Memory consolidation
- "Feeling rested" sensation

**Coaching insights:**
- Under 45 minutes = major recovery deficit
- Deep sleep occurs mostly in first half of night
- Suppressors: alcohol, late eating, room temperature, age

**Intervention triggers:**
- Deep sleep under 60 minutes consistently
- Deep sleep declining despite adequate TST

---

### 4. REM Sleep

**What it measures:** Time in "dreaming" sleep stage

**Healthy range:** 1.5-2 hours (20-25% of total sleep)

**Why it matters:**
- Emotional processing
- Cognitive restoration
- Memory consolidation
- Creative problem-solving
- Mental health maintenance

**Coaching insights:**
- REM occurs mostly in second half of night
- Suppressors: alcohol, cannabis, some medications, early waking
- Low REM correlates with mood issues

**Intervention triggers:**
- REM under 60 minutes consistently
- Client reports vivid dreams on "catching up" nights (REM rebound)

---

### 5. Sleep Latency

**What it measures:** Time from lights out to sleep onset

**Healthy range:** 10-20 minutes

**Coaching insights:**
- Under 5 minutes = sleep deprivation (falling asleep too fast)
- Over 30 minutes = onset insomnia
- Highly variable latency = inconsistent sleep pressure

**Intervention triggers:**
- Latency over 30 minutes regularly
- Latency under 5 minutes (counterintuitive concern)

---

### 6. Nighttime HRV & Heart Rate

**What it measures:** Autonomic activity during sleep

**Healthy patterns:**
- Heart rate should drop 10-20% from waking
- HRV should increase during sleep (recovery)
- Lowest HR in middle of night

**Coaching insights:**
- Elevated nighttime HR = incomplete recovery
- Low nighttime HRV = stress carried into sleep
- HR not dropping = possible sleep disorder

**Intervention triggers:**
- Nighttime HR only 5% below waking
- HRV same or lower than daytime

---

## The Sleep Assessment Protocol

### Week 1: Data Collection

**Requirements:**
- Continuous overnight monitoring (7 nights minimum)
- Morning questionnaires (subjective comparison)
- Sleep diary (bedtime, wake time, perceived quality)

**What you're looking for:**
- Baseline metrics for all 6 key areas
- Patterns across the week
- Discrepancies between perception and data

### Week 2: Pattern Analysis

**Questions to answer:**

| Question | How to Answer |
|----------|---------------|
| Is total sleep adequate? | TST average vs. 7-9 hour target |
| Is sleep efficient? | Sleep efficiency percentage |
| Is restorative sleep happening? | Deep + REM minutes |
| Are there onset issues? | Sleep latency patterns |
| Is overnight recovery occurring? | Nighttime HRV/HR |
| Is there consistency? | Day-to-day variation |

**Pattern recognition:**

| Pattern | Indicated By | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Quantity problem | Low TST, normal efficiency | Not enough time in bed |
| Quality problem | Normal TST, low efficiency | Sleep disruptions |
| Architecture problem | Normal TST & efficiency, low deep/REM | Sleep stage issues |
| Onset problem | High latency, normal other metrics | Hyperarousal at bedtime |
| Medical concern | SpO2 drops, HR abnormalities | Sleep disorder—refer |

## Intervention Protocols by Issue

### Issue: Insufficient Total Sleep

**Root cause:** Not prioritizing sleep time

**Protocol:**
1. Calculate sleep need (typically 7-8 hours + 30 min buffer)
2. Work backward from required wake time
3. Set non-negotiable "wind-down alarm" 60 min before bed
4. Remove barriers to earlier bedtime
5. Track compliance and TST response

**Expected timeline:** Improvement within 1-2 weeks if compliant

---

### Issue: Low Sleep Efficiency

**Root cause:** Disruptions, anxiety, environment, or habits

**Protocol:**

**Phase 1 - Environment (Week 1):**
- Cool bedroom (65-68°F)
- Complete darkness (blackout)
- White noise if needed
- Comfortable sleep surface

**Phase 2 - Behaviors (Week 2):**
- No screens 60-90 min before bed
- No caffeine after noon
- No alcohol within 4 hours
- No heavy meals within 3 hours
- Regular sleep/wake times (±30 min)

**Phase 3 - If still low (Week 3+):**
- Sleep restriction therapy (reduce time in bed)
- Cognitive approaches for anxiety
- Consider medical referral

**Expected timeline:** 2-4 weeks for significant improvement

---

### Issue: Low Deep Sleep

**Root cause:** Alcohol, temperature, late eating, stress, age

**Protocol:**

**Eliminate suppressors:**
- No alcohol within 4 hours of bed
- No heavy meals within 3 hours
- Cool bedroom (deep sleep requires temperature drop)
- Address chronic stress (HRV protocols)

**Enhance deep sleep:**
- Increase daytime physical activity
- Avoid naps (build sleep pressure)
- Hot bath/shower 90 min before bed (temperature drop afterward promotes deep sleep)
- Magnesium glycinate (200-400mg before bed)

**Expected timeline:** 2-4 weeks for measurable improvement

---

### Issue: Low REM Sleep

**Root cause:** Alcohol, cannabis, early waking, medications, fragmented sleep

**Protocol:**

**Eliminate suppressors:**
- No alcohol (significant REM suppressant)
- Review cannabis use
- Review medications with physician
- Address fragmentation causes

**Protect REM timing:**
- Ensure adequate total sleep (REM needs 7+ hours to fully cycle)
- Prevent early waking (light exposure, alarm timing)
- Maintain consistent wake time

**Expected timeline:** 1-3 weeks after eliminating suppressors

---

### Issue: High Sleep Latency

**Root cause:** Hyperarousal, inconsistent routine, clock-watching

**Protocol:**

**Pre-sleep routine:**
- Same routine every night (signals brain)
- No stimulating content 2 hours before bed
- Dim lighting in evening
- Resonance breathing before bed (10 min)

**Bed = sleep only:**
- No phones/screens in bed
- No work in bedroom
- If awake 20+ min, leave bed, return when sleepy

**Reduce clock-watching:**
- Remove visible clocks
- Phone face-down or out of room
- Focus on relaxation, not sleep pressure

**Expected timeline:** 2-4 weeks with consistent practice

## The Data-Driven Coaching Conversation

### Initial Assessment Conversation

**Coach:** "Your sleep data from the past two weeks shows some interesting patterns. Can I share what I'm seeing?"

**Client:** "Sure, I've been feeling tired but I thought I was sleeping okay."

**Coach:** "That's actually common—there's often a gap between how sleep feels and what's happening physiologically. Here's what the data shows:

You're averaging 6.8 hours of actual sleep, which is close to adequate. But your deep sleep is only averaging 32 minutes—it should be closer to 90 minutes. Deep sleep is where physical recovery happens, which might explain why you're tired despite getting decent hours."

**Client:** "I had no idea. What causes that?"

**Coach:** "A few things can suppress deep sleep. I noticed you typically have a glass of wine in the evenings—alcohol is actually a significant deep sleep suppressant. Your room temperature data also shows it's around 72°F, which is warmer than optimal. Let's start with those two factors and see how your deep sleep responds."

### Progress Review Conversation

**Coach:** "It's been three weeks since we adjusted your evening routine. Let me show you what happened to your sleep.

Your deep sleep went from 32 minutes average to 71 minutes—more than doubled. Your sleep efficiency also improved from 79% to 87%. And your overnight HRV is now 40% higher than when we started.

How does that match with how you're feeling?"

**Client:** "Actually, I feel significantly better. More energy in the mornings, less afternoon slump."

**Coach:** "That makes sense—the data confirms your body is now getting proper recovery. The deep sleep improvement is particularly important for the energy you're describing. Let's talk about what to focus on next."

## Red Flags Requiring Referral

| Finding | Concern | Referral |
|---------|---------|----------|
| SpO2 drops below 90% repeatedly | Sleep apnea | Sleep medicine |
| More than 10 respiratory events/hour | Sleep apnea | Sleep medicine |
| Severe insomnia not responding to intervention | Complex insomnia | Sleep specialist |
| Abnormal heart rhythms during sleep | Cardiac issue | Cardiologist |
| Sleep paralysis, hallucinations | Narcolepsy spectrum | Sleep medicine |
| Acting out dreams physically | REM behavior disorder | Neurologist |

**Your role:** Identify concerning patterns, document data, recommend appropriate referral, provide data summary for physician.
