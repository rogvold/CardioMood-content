## Week 1: Onboarding & Baseline

### Day 1-2: Client Enrollment

**Session with each client (30-45 minutes):**

1. **Explain the why**
   "We're adding objective data to our coaching. Instead of guessing, we'll know exactly what's happening with your recovery, stress, and sleep."

2. **Set expectations**
   "The first 7 days are baseline collection. We're not making changes—we're learning what's normal for you."

3. **Device setup**
   - Walk through unboxing (video call or in-person)
   - Help with app installation
   - Ensure first sync is successful
   - Confirm data is appearing in your dashboard

4. **Address concerns**
   - Privacy: "Data is encrypted and only we see it"
   - Wearing: "Most people forget it's there within 2 days"
   - Accuracy: "Keep it snug but comfortable"

**Your to-do:**
- Confirm each client's data is syncing
- Set reminder to check data on Day 3

### Day 3-4: First Data Check

**What to look for:**
- Is data syncing consistently?
- Any obvious issues (gaps, zeros, errors)?
- Initial patterns emerging?

**Common issues to troubleshoot:**
- Sync failures: Check Bluetooth connection, app permissions
- Gaps in data: Device may have been removed or battery died
- Unusual readings: Ensure proper fit

**Client communication:**
"Just checking in—how's the device feeling? I'm seeing your data come through nicely."

### Day 5-7: Baseline Completion

**Minimum baseline requirements:**
- 5+ nights of sleep data
- Consistent morning HRV readings
- All-day heart rate sampling
- Recovery score calculations

**What you're establishing:**
- Personal HRV range
- Typical sleep architecture
- Normal resting heart rate
- Baseline stress patterns

**End of Week 1 check-in:**
"We have a week of baseline data. I'm starting to see your personal patterns. Next week, we'll dive into what it all means."

---

## Week 2: Understanding the Data

### Day 8-10: Your First Data Review

**Set aside 30-45 minutes per client for deep review:**

**HRV Analysis:**
- What's their average RMSSD?
- How much day-to-day variation?
- Any concerning patterns?

**Sleep Analysis:**
- Total sleep duration average
- Deep sleep minutes
- REM sleep minutes
- Sleep efficiency percentage
- Consistency of timing

**Recovery Patterns:**
- Average recovery score
- Variation throughout week
- Correlation with activities

**Document baseline metrics:**
```
CLIENT: [Name]
BASELINE PERIOD: [Dates]
HRV: ___ ms (range: ___ to ___)
Resting HR: ___ BPM
Sleep Duration: ___ hours
Deep Sleep: ___ minutes
REM Sleep: ___ minutes
Sleep Efficiency: ___%
Recovery Score: ___% average
```

### Day 11-12: First Data Insights Session

**Client meeting structure (45-60 minutes):**

**Part 1: Show the data (15 minutes)**
Share screen or send report before meeting.

"Here's what your first week looked like. Let me walk you through the main metrics..."

Keep explanations simple:
- "HRV shows how well you recover. Higher is generally better. Yours is averaging X."
- "Deep sleep is when your body physically recovers. You're getting X minutes—ideally we want 90+."

**Part 2: Connect data to experience (10 minutes)**

"On Thursday your HRV dropped 25%. What was happening that day?"

Look for correlations:
- Late nights → poor HRV next day
- Stressful events → elevated HR
- Alcohol → reduced deep sleep

**Part 3: Identify one focus area (10 minutes)**

Don't overwhelm. Pick ONE thing:
- If deep sleep is low: Sleep hygiene intervention
- If HRV is consistently low: Stress management focus
- If recovery never comes: Training load adjustment

"For the next two weeks, let's focus specifically on [ONE THING]."

**Part 4: Set up monitoring (10 minutes)**

"I'll be watching your [focus metric]. If it improves, we know the intervention is working. If not, we'll adjust."

### Day 13-14: Implementation Support

**Daily brief check of dashboards:**
- Is data still syncing?
- Any alerts triggered?
- Is the focus intervention showing early signs?

**Client touchpoint:**
"How's [the intervention] going? I'm seeing [early observation from data]."

---

## Week 3: Intervention & Learning

### Day 15-17: First Intervention Assessment

**Two weeks of data now available. Look for:**

1. **Trend direction** - Is the focus metric improving?
2. **Pattern changes** - Has the pattern shifted?
3. **Correlations confirmed** - Do suspected triggers show up in data?

**If improving:** Reinforce behavior, continue intervention

**If not improving:** Assess compliance, consider barriers, adjust approach

**Document observations:**
```
INTERVENTION: [What was implemented]
PERIOD: [Dates]
FOCUS METRIC BEFORE: ___
FOCUS METRIC AFTER: ___
CHANGE: ___%
NOTES: [Client compliance, observations, next steps]
```

### Day 18-19: Platform Mastery

By now, you should be comfortable with:
- [ ] Dashboard navigation
- [ ] Alert interpretation
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Client comparison to baseline
- [ ] Basic pattern recognition

**Challenge yourself:**
- Find a correlation you didn't expect
- Predict a client's recovery score before checking (then verify)
- Identify the best day for a client to tackle something challenging

### Day 20-21: Week 3 Review

**Client check-in (30 minutes):**

"It's been two weeks since we started focusing on [intervention]. Here's what the data shows..."

**Show progress visually:**
Charts and graphs are powerful. Even modest improvement looks significant as a trend line.

**Celebrate wins:**
"Your deep sleep increased from 41 minutes to 68 minutes. That's a 66% improvement in two weeks."

**Adjust as needed:**
"Your sleep is improving, but I'm now noticing your stress index is elevated on Mondays. Let's address that next."

---

## Week 4: Confidence & Independence

### Day 22-24: Expanding Metrics

**Now that basics are comfortable, explore:**

- Training load patterns (if client exercises)
- Stress index in relation to work schedule
- Weekend vs. weekday recovery differences
- Respiratory rate during sleep
- Heart rate response to activities

**Start connecting multiple metrics:**
"I notice that your low HRV days always follow nights where your deep sleep was under 50 minutes. Sleep quality is driving recovery."

### Day 25-26: Developing Your Workflow

**Establish your routine:**

**Daily (5-10 minutes total):**
- Quick dashboard scan
- Address any red alerts
- Note patterns for weekly review

**Weekly (30-60 minutes total):**
- Deep review of all clients
- Prepare for client sessions
- Document insights and progress
- Plan adjustments

**Per client session:**
- Data review before meeting
- Show progress/patterns
- Connect to interventions
- Set next focus

### Day 27-28: One-Month Assessment

**For each client, document:**

| Metric | Day 1 | Day 28 | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| HRV | | | |
| Resting HR | | | |
| Deep sleep | | | |
| Sleep efficiency | | | |
| Recovery score | | | |

**Qualitative assessment:**
- Client engagement with data: High/Medium/Low
- Data-behavior connection: Strong/Moderate/Weak
- Intervention effectiveness: Successful/Partial/Needs adjustment

### Day 29-30: Month-End Review

**Client session (45-60 minutes):**

"It's been a month. Let me show you how far you've come..."

**Show before/after:**
Side-by-side comparison is powerful. Visualize the transformation.

**Connect to feelings:**
"Your HRV improved 35%. How does that match with how you've been feeling?"

**Plan month 2:**
"Now that [first focus] is improving, let's add [second focus]."

**With yourself:**
- What worked well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What will you do differently with next clients?
- Ready to add more clients?

## Common First-30-Days Challenges

### Challenge: Data Overwhelm

**Symptom:** Spending too much time analyzing, paralysis by analysis

**Solution:** Focus on 3 metrics only for first month:
1. HRV trend
2. Deep sleep
3. Recovery score

Everything else can wait.

### Challenge: Client Non-Compliance

**Symptom:** Client not wearing device consistently

**Solution:**
- Understand the barrier (comfort? forgetfulness? skepticism?)
- Emphasize minimum viable data (sleep + morning reading)
- Show early insights that require the data
- If persistent, may not be right client for data approach

### Challenge: No Obvious Patterns

**Symptom:** Data seems random, no clear insights

**Solution:**
- Wait—patterns emerge over 2-3 weeks
- Check for confounding variables
- Compare weekdays to weekends
- Look at weekly rather than daily patterns
- Some clients have genuinely high variability

### Challenge: Conflicting Data and Feelings

**Symptom:** Client "feels great" but data looks poor (or vice versa)

**Solution:**
- Neither is wrong—both are information
- Explain lag: Physiology changes before feelings
- Or explain perception: Feelings can miss gradual decline
- Focus on trends, not single days
