## Introduction

Data-driven coaching isn't for every coach or every client.

It requires investment—financial, time, and mental. It changes how you work. It demands new skills.

For the right coaches, it transforms practice and outcomes. For the wrong fit, it becomes an expensive frustration.

This checklist helps you honestly assess whether data-driven coaching is right for you, right now. Answer honestly—there's no judgment, only clarity.

## Interpretation Guide

### 120-144: Strong Fit — Proceed with Confidence

You have the foundation, mindset, and resources for successful implementation. Data-driven coaching aligns with your goals and capabilities.

**Next step:** Choose a platform and start your pilot with 2-3 clients within 30 days.

---

### 96-119: Good Fit — Proceed with Awareness

You're well-positioned overall, but have some areas to strengthen. Success is likely with attention to weaker areas.

**Areas scoring below 12:**
These need attention before or during implementation.

**Next step:** Address lowest-scoring areas first. Consider starting with a smaller pilot to build confidence.

---

### 72-95: Moderate Fit — Proceed with Caution

Data-driven coaching can work for you, but significant gaps need addressing. Rushing in may lead to frustration.

**Recommendations:**
- Focus on 2-3 weakest sections first
- Consider a longer runway before full implementation
- Start very small (1-2 clients)
- Seek additional training or support

**Next step:** Create a 90-day readiness plan addressing gaps before committing to platforms.

---

### 48-71: Questionable Fit — Consider Alternatives

Multiple significant barriers exist. Forcing data-driven coaching may create more problems than it solves.

**Consider:**
- Is this the right time?
- Are there foundational issues to address first?
- Would a different growth strategy serve you better?
- Would implementing in 6-12 months after addressing gaps work better?

**Next step:** Honestly assess whether this is a "not now" or "not ever" decision. Some coaches thrive without biometrics.

---

### Below 48: Poor Fit — Not Recommended Now

Current conditions don't support successful implementation. Attempting data-driven coaching now would likely be frustrating and expensive.

**This doesn't mean forever.** It means not now.

**Focus instead on:**
- Building business fundamentals
- Developing client base
- Improving technical comfort
- Addressing financial stability

**Revisit this checklist in 6-12 months** after strengthening foundational areas.

## Section-Specific Insights

### If Business Fundamentals scored low:

You need a stable foundation before adding complexity. Focus on:
- Growing client base to 10+
- Establishing consistent revenue
- Building pricing power

### If Client Base Fit scored low:

Your current clients may not be ideal for data-driven coaching. Options:
- Segment clients (use data with some, not all)
- Attract new clients seeking data-driven approach
- Accept data may not be your differentiation

### If Mindset & Interest scored low:

Forcing interest rarely works. Consider:
- Is this genuinely something you want?
- Would partnering with tech-oriented coach work?
- Are there other ways to differentiate?

### If Technical Comfort scored low:

Technology anxiety is real but addressable:
- Take platform training courses
- Start with simplest possible setup
- Get personal support during transition
- Hire tech-savvy assistant

### If Practice Goals scored low:

Data-driven may not serve your goals:
- Reassess what you're actually trying to achieve
- Consider if other strategies fit better
- Data is a tool—ensure it serves your vision

### If Coaching Philosophy scored low:

Values misalignment creates lasting friction:
- Explore whether data can complement (not replace) your approach
- Visit coaches successfully integrating both
- Consider whether this is a growth edge or genuine mismatch

### If Time Availability scored low:

You can't add without subtracting:
- What can you stop doing or delegate?
- Can you reduce client load temporarily?
- Is now the right time for any new initiative?

### If Financial Investment scored low:

Undercapitalized launches struggle:
- Build runway before committing
- Start with lower-cost platform options
- Consider phased investment approach

## Final Reflection Questions

Before making your decision, sit with these:

1. **In one year, what would success look like?**
   Does data-driven coaching fit that vision?

2. **What would you have to give up to implement this?**
   Is that trade-off worth it?

3. **If this failed completely, what would happen?**
   Can you absorb that outcome?

4. **Are you excited or anxious about this?**
   Excitement suggests fit; pure anxiety suggests forcing.

5. **What does your gut say?**
   Beyond the numbers, what's the deeper knowing?

---
