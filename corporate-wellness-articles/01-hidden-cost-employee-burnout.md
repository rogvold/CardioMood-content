## Introduction

When an employee burns out and leaves, the invoice doesn't arrive in the mail. But the costs are real—and substantial.

Recruiting, hiring, and training a replacement costs 50-200% of annual salary. Add lost productivity during transition, institutional knowledge that walks out the door, and the ripple effects on remaining team members, and a single burnout-driven departure easily reaches $15,000 to $25,000 or more.

**Burnout isn't just a wellness issue. It's a financial crisis hiding in plain sight.**

## The True Cost of Burnout Turnover

### Direct Costs

| Cost Category | Typical Range |
|--------------|---------------|
| Recruiting/advertising | $2,000-5,000 |
| Interview time (internal) | $1,000-3,000 |
| Background checks/assessments | $500-1,500 |
| Onboarding/training | $3,000-10,000 |
| Administrative processing | $500-1,000 |
| **Direct Total** | **$7,000-20,500** |

### Indirect Costs

| Cost Category | Typical Range |
|--------------|---------------|
| Lost productivity (vacancy) | $3,000-8,000 |
| Ramp-up period (new hire) | $2,000-5,000 |
| Manager time | $1,000-3,000 |
| Team productivity impact | $1,000-4,000 |
| Client/project disruption | Variable |
| **Indirect Total** | **$7,000-20,000** |

### Hidden Costs

| Cost Category | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Institutional knowledge loss | Unmeasurable but significant |
| Cultural impact | Team morale affected |
| Remaining employee overload | Cascading burnout risk |
| Client relationship disruption | Revenue risk |

## The Burnout Cascade

### How One Burnout Creates More

**The cascade effect:**
1. Employee burns out and leaves
2. Work redistributed to remaining team
3. Remaining team stress increases
4. Quality and deadlines suffer
5. More team members burn out
6. Additional departures follow

**One burnout-driven departure can trigger 2-3 more within 6 months.**

### Department-Level Impact

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| 1 burnout departure | $15-25K |
| Cascade of 3 departures | $45-75K |
| Team performance decline | 20-30% |
| Client relationship damage | Revenue loss |

## Why Traditional Wellness Programs Fail

### The Problem with Annual Surveys

**Traditional approach:**
- Annual engagement survey
- Aggregate results reviewed
- Initiatives planned
- Implementation months later

**What's wrong:**
- Snapshot, not continuous
- Too late when burnout visible
- No individual early warning
- No real-time intervention

### The Warning Signs Missed

| Warning Sign | Traditional Detection |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Declining sleep quality | Not measured |
| Elevated stress patterns | Not measured |
| Reduced recovery | Not measured |
| Activity changes | Not measured |
| Early burnout trajectory | Invisible until too late |

---

## The Cost of Detection Delay

### Burnout Timeline

| Stage | Symptoms | Intervention Success |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Early (weeks 1-4) | Subtle biometric changes | High (80%+) |
| Developing (weeks 4-8) | Self-reported stress | Moderate (50-60%) |
| Established (weeks 8-12) | Performance impact | Low (30-40%) |
| Crisis (12+ weeks) | Departure imminent | Very low (<20%) |

### The 3-Week Advantage

**Research shows:**
- Biometric signs of burnout appear 3+ weeks before self-reporting
- Early intervention at biometric stage has 80%+ success rate
- Waiting for self-reporting cuts success rate in half
- Crisis intervention rarely prevents departure

**Early detection = prevention = savings.**

## Quantifying Prevention ROI

### Per-Employee Calculation

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual turnover rate | 15-20% |
| Burnout-attributed portion | 30-40% |
| Average departure cost | $20,000 |
| Prevention success rate | 30-50% |

### 1,000-Employee Company Example

**Without prevention:**
- Annual departures: 175 (17.5% rate)
- Burnout-related: 60 (35%)
- Turnover cost: $1.2M

**With biometric early warning:**
- Burnout departures prevented: 20-30
- Savings: $400K-600K
- Program cost: $100K-150K
- **Net ROI: 3:1 to 4:1**

## How Biometric Early Warning Works

### Detection Mechanism

**Continuous monitoring reveals:**

| Metric | Burnout Pattern |
|--------|----------------|
| HRV | Progressive decline over weeks |
| Resting heart rate | Gradual elevation |
| Sleep quality | Deteriorating efficiency |
| Activity patterns | Changes from baseline |
| Recovery | Inadequate even on weekends |

### Alert and Intervention

| Alert Level | Trigger | Response |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Awareness | Early pattern change | Self-directed resources |
| Coaching | Developing trajectory | Health coach outreach |
| Intervention | Significant concern | Manager/HR involvement |
| Crisis | Acute indicators | Immediate support |
