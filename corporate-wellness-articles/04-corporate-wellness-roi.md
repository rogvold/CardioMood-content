## Introduction

"Show me the ROI" is the question that ends most wellness program conversations with CFOs.

The evidence is clear: well-designed wellness programs return $3 or more for every dollar invested. But generic industry statistics don't satisfy finance leaders. They want to see your numbers, from your program, for your company.

**This guide shows how to build, measure, and prove wellness ROI.**

| Study/Source | Reported ROI |
|-------------|--------------|
| Johnson & Johnson (30-year program) | 2.7:1 |
| Harvard Meta-Analysis (2010) | 3.3:1 (medical costs), 2.7:1 (absenteeism) |
| RAND Corporation | 1.5:1 to 3:1 (varies by program) |
| Optum Research | 3:1 average |

### Where Returns Come From

| Source | % of Returns |
|--------|-------------|

## Building the ROI Model

### Cost Components

**Program investment:**

| Component | Typical Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Platform/technology | $30-100/employee/year |
| Wearable devices | $100-300/employee (one-time) |
| Coaching/support | $50-200/employee/year |
| Incentives | $100-500/employee/year |
| Administration | $20-50/employee/year |
| **Total Year 1** | **$300-1,000/employee** |
| **Ongoing Annual** | **$200-700/employee** |

### Return Components

**Healthcare cost savings:**

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Baseline healthcare cost | Your current PEPM |
| Expected reduction | 5-15% for engaged participants |
| Participation rate | Your enrollment × engagement rate |
| Savings | Baseline × reduction × participation |

**Example:**
- 1,000 employees, $500 PEPM, 50% engaged
- 10% reduction for engaged
- Savings: 500 × $500 × 12 × 10% = $300,000/year
