## Introduction

Replacing an employee costs 50% to 200% of their annual salary. For a $75,000 employee, that's $37,500 to $150,000 in recruiting, training, and lost productivity.

Yet many turnover drivers are wellness-related: burnout, stress, poor work-life balance, and health issues. Comprehensive wellness programs address these root causes.

**This guide quantifies the turnover-wellness connection and shows how to reduce costly departures.**
