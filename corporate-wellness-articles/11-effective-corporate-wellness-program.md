## Introduction

Most corporate wellness programs are wellness theater—visible activity with minimal impact.

The difference between effective programs and ineffective ones isn't budget or technology. It's design: understanding what drives health outcomes, what motivates participation, and what creates lasting change.

**This guide covers the design principles that separate winners from losers.**

## Why Most Programs Fail

### Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Why It Happens |
|---------|---------------|
| Low participation | Poor incentives, irrelevance |
| No outcomes | Wrong interventions |
| Short-term only | No sustained engagement |
| Leadership disconnect | Not modeled from top |
| One-size-fits-all | Ignores individual needs |
| Measurement void | No accountability |

### The Wellness Theater Problem

**Signs of wellness theater:**
- Annual health fair, no follow-up
- Wellness newsletter nobody reads
- Gym discount 5% use
- Screening without intervention
- Program exists for "checking box"

## Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: Start with Strategy

**Before tactics, answer:**
- What business outcomes matter?
- What health drivers affect those outcomes?
- What's the current state?
- What change is achievable?

### Principle 2: Segment and Target

**Not everyone needs the same thing:**

| Population | Needs | Program |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| High-risk | Intensive management | Disease management |
| Rising-risk | Targeted intervention | Lifestyle programs |
| Healthy | Maintenance | Engagement, prevention |

### Principle 3: Make It Easy

**Every friction point loses people:**
- One-click enrollment
- Mobile-first design
- Minimal paperwork
- Seamless integration

### Principle 4: Incentivize Effectively

**What works:**
- Meaningful rewards
- Attainable goals
- Quick wins
- Social recognition

### Principle 5: Measure Outcomes

**Track what matters:**
- Health improvements
- Cost impacts
- Productivity changes
- Engagement depth
