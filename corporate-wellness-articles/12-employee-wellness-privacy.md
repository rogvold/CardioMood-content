## Introduction

Privacy is the make-or-break factor for wellness program participation.

Employees who don't trust how their health data will be used simply won't participate—or they'll game the system with minimal engagement. Privacy-first design isn't just ethical; it's essential for program effectiveness.

**This guide shows how to build wellness programs employees trust.**

## Privacy-First Design Principles

### Principle 1: Voluntary Participation

**Essential elements:**
- Opt-in, never default
- Easy opt-out anytime
- No penalty for non-participation
- No employment consequences

### Principle 2: Employee Data Control

**Employees should:**
- Own their personal data
- Control what they share
- Access all their data
- Delete data if desired

### Principle 3: Aggregate-Only Employer Access

**Employers see:**
- Population-level trends
- Department aggregates (with size thresholds)
- Program effectiveness metrics
- **Never individual health data**

### Principle 4: Clear Purpose Limitation

**Data used only for:**
- Individual health insights (to employee)
- Population health (aggregate)
- Program improvement
- **Never for employment decisions**

## Communication Strategy

### Transparency in Practice

| Communication | Content |
|--------------|---------|
| Pre-enrollment | Exactly what data is collected |
| During enrollment | How data is used, who sees what |
| Ongoing | Regular privacy reminders |
| Policy changes | Clear notification |

### Plain Language Privacy Policy

**Avoid:**
- Legal jargon
- Vague statements
- Buried disclosures
- Confusing structure

**Use:**
- Simple language
- Clear examples
- Visual explanations
- FAQ format

### Key Messages

| Message | Framing |
|---------|---------|
| Data ownership | "Your data belongs to you" |
| Employer access | "Your employer never sees individual health data" |
| Control | "You decide what to share and when" |
| Purpose | "Data is used only to help you improve health" |
| Security | "Bank-level encryption protects your information" |

## Technical Privacy Protections

### Data Architecture

| Protection | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Data separation | Individual vs. aggregate databases |
| Encryption | At rest and in transit |
| Access controls | Role-based, least privilege |
| Audit logging | All access tracked |
| Pseudonymization | Where possible |

### Aggregate Reporting Thresholds

| Level | Threshold | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Company-wide | No minimum | Full anonymity |
| Division | 50+ employees | Re-identification risk |
| Department | 25+ employees | Statistical significance |
| Team | Not reported | Too identifiable |

### Individual Protections

| Protection | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Secure personal dashboard | Only employee access |
| Export capability | Data portability |
| Deletion rights | Complete data removal |
| Correction ability | Fix errors |

## Addressing Specific Concerns

### "Will my manager see my stress levels?"

**Answer:**
"No. Your individual health data is never shared with your manager, HR, or anyone at your company. Your employer only sees aggregate trends across the whole population—for example, 'average stress is improving'—never individual information."

### "Could this affect my job?"

**Answer:**
"Participation is completely voluntary, and your employment is never affected by your health data or participation decision. This is strictly prohibited by company policy and the law."

### "What if there's a data breach?"

**Answer:**
"We use bank-level encryption and security. Your health data is stored separately from your employment records. Even if a breach occurred, your data is encrypted and not linked to your identity in a way that could be exposed."

### "Can I delete my data?"

**Answer:**
"Yes. You can delete your data at any time through the app. We'll retain only what's legally required and remove everything else."

| Regulation | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|

### Compliance Framework
