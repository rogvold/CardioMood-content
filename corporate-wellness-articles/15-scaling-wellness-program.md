## Introduction

A successful pilot doesn't guarantee successful scaling. Many wellness programs show great results with 100 employees but struggle at 10,000.

Scaling requires different infrastructure, communication, support models, and measurement approaches. This guide covers the transition from pilot success to enterprise deployment.

## The Pilot Phase

### Pilot Design

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Size | 100-500 employees |
| Duration | 6-12 months |
| Population | Representative mix |
| Goals | Validate concept, measure impact |

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Participation rate | >50% |
| Engagement | >70% of participants active |
| Satisfaction | >80% positive |
| Outcomes | Measurable improvement |
| Scalability indicators | Process works |

## Preparing to Scale

### Infrastructure Readiness

| Area | Scale Requirements |
|------|-------------------|
| Technology | Multi-region, high availability |
| Support | Scalable support model |
| Communication | Automated, segmented |

| Phase 2 | Pilot expansion (2x) | Months 1-3 |
| Phase 3 | Major regions | Months 4-6 |
| Phase 4 | Enterprise-wide | Months 7-12 |

### Geographic Rollout

| Region | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|
| Headquarters | Start here, refine |
| Major offices | Next wave |
| Smaller locations | Follow |
| Remote workers | Parallel or final |

## Common Scaling Challenges

### Challenge 1: Support Overwhelm

**Problem:** Support model that worked for 100 can't handle 5,000

**Solution:**
- Self-service resources
- Tiered support model
- FAQ and chatbots
- Champion network

### Challenge 2: Communication Fatigue

**Problem:** Broadcast emails get ignored at scale

**Solution:**
- Targeted messaging
- Multiple channels
- Manager cascade
- Mobile-first

### Challenge 3: Engagement Dilution

**Problem:** Pilot enthusiasm doesn't transfer

**Solution:**
- Local champions
- Department competitions
- Executive visibility
- Fresh challenges

### Challenge 4: Infrastructure Strain

**Problem:** Systems designed for pilot break

**Solution:**
- Load testing before scale
- Scalable architecture
- Vendor capacity confirmation
- Monitoring and alerts
