## Introduction

Burnout isn't just feeling tired—it's a physiological state measurable through the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides an objective window into this system, detecting burnout patterns weeks before employees recognize them.

## Understanding HRV

### What HRV Measures

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Heart rate variability | Variation in time between heartbeats |
| Normal variation | Heart isn't a metronome—it speeds and slows |
| Health indicator | Higher variability = healthier system |
| Autonomic function | Reflects nervous system balance |

### The Autonomic Nervous System

| Branch | Function | HRV Effect |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Sympathetic | "Fight or flight" | Decreases HRV |
| Parasympathetic | "Rest and digest" | Increases HRV |
| Balance | Healthy state | Optimal HRV |

## HRV and Burnout

### The Burnout Trajectory

| Stage | HRV Pattern |
|-------|------------|
| Healthy | Normal, variable HRV |
| Stress activation | Decreased HRV, increased HR |
| Chronic stress | Sustained low HRV |
| Burnout | Severely depressed HRV |
| Collapse | Paradoxical patterns |

### Key HRV Metrics

| Metric | Burnout Indication |
|--------|-------------------|
| RMSSD | Primary indicator—declining trend |
| SDNN | Overall variability—decreased |
| LF/HF ratio | Sympathetic dominance |
| Recovery patterns | Failure to restore overnight |

---

## Detection Patterns

### Early Warning Signs

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| 5-10% HRV decline | Early alert |
| No weekend recovery | Recovery failure |
| Rising resting HR | Sustained activation |
| Sleep HRV drop | Even rest is stressed |

### Critical Indicators

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| 15-20%+ HRV decline | Significant concern |
| Baseline shift | New lower normal |
| Recovery collapse | No restoration |
| Multi-metric alignment | Pattern confirmation |

---

## From Detection to Intervention

### Alert Thresholds

| Threshold | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Mild decline | Awareness resources |
| Moderate decline | Coaching outreach |
| Significant decline | Active intervention |
| Critical | Immediate support |

### Intervention Effectiveness

| Timing | Success Rate |
|--------|-------------|
| Early detection | 80-90% |
| Moderate stage | 50-60% |
| Late stage | 20-30% |

## Key Takeaways

1. **HRV is objective:** Measures autonomic function
2. **Burnout shows in HRV:** Progressive decline pattern
3. **Early detection possible:** 3+ weeks advantage
4. **RMSSD is primary:** Key metric for burnout
5. **Recovery patterns matter:** Overnight restoration failure
6. **Multi-metric confirmation:** Combine with other signals
7. **Early intervention works:** 80-90% success rate
8. **Continuous monitoring:** Enables prevention
