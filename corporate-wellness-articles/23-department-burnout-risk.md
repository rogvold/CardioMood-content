## Introduction

Burnout doesn't strike randomly—it clusters. Certain departments, teams, or projects show elevated risk long before individuals collapse. Aggregate wellness data reveals these patterns, enabling targeted intervention.

## Department-Level Risk Factors

### Common High-Risk Patterns

|--------|----------------|
| Sustained overtime | Extended work hours |

| Major changes | Reorganizations, new leadership |

### Industry-Specific Risks

|-----------------|-------------------|
| Customer service | Emotional labor, metrics pressure |

## Using Aggregate Data

### What to Monitor

| Metric | Department-Level View |

| Participation | Engagement levels |

### Risk Stratification

| Risk Level | Indicators |
|------------|------------|
| Low | Stable HRV, good recovery |
| Moderate | Minor decline, some recovery issues |
| Elevated | 10-15% HRV decline, recovery problems |
| High | Significant decline, multiple indicators |
| Critical | Severe patterns, turnover starting |

## Early Warning Signs

### Leading Indicators

|--------|------------------|
| 5-10% HRV decline | Early stress elevation |
| Weekend recovery failure | Inadequate rest |

### Lagging Indicators

## Intervention Strategies

## Privacy Considerations

### Aggregate Only

|-----------|-------------|
| Minimum team size | 10+ for department view |
| No individual attribution | Aggregate patterns only |
| Trend focus | Patterns, not snapshots |
| Transparent purpose | Clear communication |
