## Introduction

High-performing organizations have high stress—that's unavoidable. The difference between thriving and burning out isn't stress levels; it's recovery capacity. Employees who recover fully can handle sustained demands; those who don't eventually collapse.

## The Recovery Paradigm

### Why Recovery Matters More

| Stress Reality | Recovery Reality |
|---------------|------------------|
| High stress is common | Recovery is controllable |
| Some stress is beneficial | No recovery is harmful |
| Stress is often external | Recovery is internal capacity |
| Can't eliminate stress | Can improve recovery |

### The Recovery Equation

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| High stress + good recovery | Sustainable performance |
| Low stress + poor recovery | Surprising burnout |
| High stress + poor recovery | Rapid decline |
| Low stress + good recovery | Thriving |
