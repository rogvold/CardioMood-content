## Introduction

Most wellness programs fail—not spectacularly, but through gradual decline into irrelevance. Understanding why programs fail helps you avoid the same traps. These mistakes are predictable, preventable, and unfortunately common.

## Strategic Mistakes

### 1. No Executive Sponsorship

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Budget cuts when times get tough | Program dies |
| Managers don't prioritize | Low participation |
| No organizational change | Wellness in a silo |

**Prevention:** Secure visible, active executive sponsorship before launch.

### 2. Unclear Success Metrics

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Can't show ROI | Budget justification fails |
| No baseline measurement | Can't prove improvement |
| Wrong metrics tracked | Miss actual impact |

**Prevention:** Define metrics upfront, establish baselines, measure consistently.

### 3. Treating Wellness as a Program, Not Culture

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Wellness disconnected from work | Seen as extra burden |
| No policy changes | Systemic issues persist |
| Launch-and-forget | Enthusiasm fades |

**Prevention:** Integrate wellness into how work works, not just what's offered.

## Design Mistakes

### 4. One-Size-Fits-All Approach

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Generic content | Low relevance |
| Single activity type | Limited appeal |
| Ignoring demographics | Exclusion of groups |

**Prevention:** Personalization, variety, and inclusive design.

### 5. Ignoring Privacy Concerns

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Low adoption | People don't trust |
| Vocal resistance | Negative culture impact |
| Compliance risk | Legal exposure |

**Prevention:** Privacy-first design, transparent communication, voluntary participation.

### 6. Insufficient Incentives

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Low participation | Not worth the effort |
| Drop-off after initial enrollment | No sustained value |
| "What's in it for me?" | Unanswered question |

**Prevention:** Meaningful incentives, both intrinsic and extrinsic.

## Implementation Mistakes

### 7. Poor Communication

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Employees don't know it exists | No awareness |
| Confusion about how it works | Friction to start |
| Skepticism unaddressed | Concerns fester |

**Prevention:** Multi-channel, sustained communication with clear messaging.

### 8. Technical Friction

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Separate login required | Barrier to access |
| Complex onboarding | Abandonment |
| Buggy or slow platform | Frustration |

**Prevention:** SSO integration, simple onboarding, reliable technology.

### 9. No Manager Enablement

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Managers don't support | Employees feel permission is lacking |
| No workload adjustment | Can't participate |
| Wellness conflicts with work | Impossible to engage |

**Prevention:** Manager training, clear expectations, workload consideration.

## Operational Mistakes

### 10. Launch Without Sustained Plan

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Great launch, then silence | Momentum fades |
| No fresh content or activities | Boredom |
| Initial spike, then decline | Unsustainable |

**Prevention:** 12-month engagement plan with regular activities and fresh content.

### 11. Not Acting on Data

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Collect data, no action | Cynicism |
| Insights but no intervention | Waste of capability |
| Dashboard unused | Expensive decoration |

**Prevention:** Clear workflows from insight to action, accountability for response.

### 12. Ignoring Systemic Issues

| Symptom | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Wellness apps while overworking | Hollow gesture |
| Individual solutions for systemic problems | Doesn't work |
| Burnout continues despite program | Failed investment |

**Prevention:** Address workload, culture, and policy alongside individual tools.
