## Introduction

Falls are the leading cause of injury in seniors—and most are predictable. Activity patterns change days to weeks before a fall: slower movement, reduced activity, changes in gait. Monitoring these patterns enables intervention before falls happen.

## The Fall Problem

### Statistics

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Annual falls (65+) | 1 in 4 seniors |
| Falls causing injury | 20-30% |
| Hip fractures from falls | 300,000/year (US) |
| Deaths from falls | 36,000/year (US) |
| Average fall injury cost | $35,000 |

### Consequences

| Outcome | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Physical injury | Fractures, head trauma |
| Fear of falling | Reduced activity, isolation |
| Loss of independence | Can't live alone |
| Facility placement | Often permanent |
| Mortality | 20-30% die within year of hip fracture |

## How Monitoring Prevents Falls

### Early Warning Signs

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Reduced daily steps | Declining mobility |
| Slower movement speed | Balance/strength issues |
| Increased sedentary time | Deconditioning |
| Changes in gait pattern | Coordination problems |
| Nighttime activity increase | Sleep disturbance/confusion |

### Detection Timeline

| Signal | Lead Time |
|--------|-----------|
| Activity reduction | 1-2 weeks |
| Movement slowing | 5-7 days |
| Gait changes | Days |
| Balance indicators | Days |

## The Evidence

### Research Findings

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| BMC Geriatrics 2019 | 40% reduction in fall injuries |
| Journal of Gerontology | Activity decline predicts falls |
| Sensors 2020 | Wearable gait analysis detects risk |
| Age and Ageing | Movement monitoring prevents falls |

### Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Prevention |
|-----------|------------|
| Early detection | Intervene before fall |
| Risk stratification | Target highest risk |
| Trend visibility | Catch gradual decline |
| Behavior insights | Address root causes |

---

## Intervention Strategies

### When Patterns Indicate Risk

| Alert Level | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| Mild decline | Encourage activity |
| Moderate decline | Physical therapy referral |
| Significant decline | Medical evaluation |
| Acute change | Immediate assessment |

### Prevention Actions

| Intervention | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Physical therapy | Improve strength/balance |
| Medication review | Address side effects |
| Vision check | Correct impairment |
| Home modification | Remove hazards |
| Nutrition improvement | Address weakness |

## Monitoring Implementation

### What to Track

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Daily step count | Activity level |
| Active minutes | Sustained movement |
| Movement patterns | Gait and balance |
| Sedentary periods | Deconditioning risk |
| Sleep activity | Nighttime safety |

### Family Dashboard

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Activity summary | Daily at-a-glance |
| Trend charts | Week-over-week comparison |
| Risk indicators | Fall risk score |
| Alert notifications | When patterns change |

---
