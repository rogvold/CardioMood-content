## Introduction

We trust periodic checkups to catch health problems—but the math doesn't work. A quarterly visit captures 0.1% of a senior's life. The other 99.9% remains invisible. For a population where health can change rapidly, this gap is dangerous.

## The Periodic Visit Problem

### Time Coverage

| Visit Frequency | Coverage |
|-----------------|----------|
| Annual exam | 0.03% of time |
| Quarterly visits | 0.1% of time |
| Monthly visits | 0.4% of time |
| Weekly home health | 1.4% of time |
| Continuous monitoring | 100% of time |

### What Happens Between Visits

| Change Type | Visibility |
|-------------|------------|
| Gradual vital sign shift | Invisible |
| Sleep quality decline | Never assessed |
| Activity level drop | May not mention |
| Heart rhythm changes | Brief check misses |
| Early illness signs | Undetected |

## Hidden Dangers

### The Cliff Effect

| Pattern | Danger |
|---------|--------|
| Slow decline | Invisible until crisis |
| "Fine" at visits | Struggling between them |
| Compensated state | Hiding problems |
| Sudden decompensation | "Came out of nowhere" |

### Examples of Missed Decline

| What Happens | What Doctor Sees |
|--------------|------------------|
| Gradual HRV decline over weeks | Normal at visit |
| Increasing nighttime awakenings | "Sleep is fine" |
| Daily activity dropping 20% | "I'm doing okay" |
| Early morning HR elevated | Within normal at 10am visit |

## Why Seniors Underreport

### Contributing Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Normalization | "Just getting older" |
| Fear | Don't want to worry family |
| Denial | Hope it will pass |
| Memory | Forget symptoms by appointment |
| Stoicism | Don't complain |

### The Recall Problem

| Reality | What's Reported |
|---------|-----------------|
| Felt tired last Tuesday | "I've been fine" |
| Dizzy episode last week | Forgotten |
| Sleep disrupted for days | "Normal" |
| Activity declined 30% | Doesn't notice gradual change |

|------------|-------|
| 24/7 data collection | No gaps |
| Personal baseline | Detect individual change |

### What Continuous Monitoring Catches

| Sleep disruption | Ongoing patterns |
| Activity reduction | Week-over-week trends |
| Heart rate changes | Continuous tracking |
| Recovery problems | Overnight assessment |

## Complementing Care

### Not Replacing Doctors

| Role | Periodic Visits | Continuous Monitoring |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Physical exam | Yes | No |
| Lab work | Yes | No |
| Prescribing | Yes | No |
| Subjective assessment | Yes | Supplements |
| Objective trends | Point-in-time | Continuous |
| Early detection | Limited | Strong |

### Better Together

| Integration | Value |
