## Introduction

An alert appears on your phone: "Attention: Heart rate variability below baseline." What does that mean? Should you call an ambulance? Wait and watch? Understanding alert levels and appropriate responses prevents both over-reaction and dangerous under-reaction.

## Alert Level Overview

### Standard Alert Hierarchy

| Level | Meaning | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| All Clear | Everything normal | None needed |
| Attention | Minor variation | Awareness only |
| Concern | Notable change | Check in |
| Alert | Significant deviation | Contact doctor |
| Urgent | Critical pattern | Immediate action |

### What Triggers Each Level

| Level | Typical Triggers |
|-------|------------------|
| Attention | 5-10% from baseline |
| Concern | 10-15% from baseline, single metric |
| Alert | >15% from baseline, multiple metrics |
| Urgent | Severe patterns, combined indicators |

## Common Alert Types

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

| Alert | Meaning | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| HRV slightly low | Minor stress or fatigue | Monitor |
| HRV declining trend | Possible developing issue | Check in, watch closely |
| HRV significantly low | Body under stress | Contact doctor |
| HRV critically low | Possible medical issue | Seek care |

### Resting Heart Rate

| Alert | Meaning | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Elevated resting HR | Possible illness, stress | Monitor |
| Persistently elevated | Body fighting something | Contact doctor |
| Significantly elevated | May indicate infection | Seek evaluation |

### Sleep Patterns

### Activity Levels

| Alert | Meaning | Response |

## Reading Combined Signals

### Multiple Alerts Together

| Pattern | Possible Meaning |
|---------|------------------|
| Low HRV + elevated HR | Illness developing |
| Poor sleep + reduced activity | Health decline |
| Multiple declining trends | Significant concern |
| All indicators stable | Isolated anomaly likely |

### Context Matters

| Situation | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| After travel | Expect some disruption |
| During illness | Elevated alerts normal |
| After activity change | Baseline adjusting |
| Seasonal change | Some variation expected |

## Response Decision Tree

### When to Wait and Watch

| Situation | Action |
