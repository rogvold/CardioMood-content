## Introduction

Caring for an aging parent from hundreds or thousands of miles away feels impossible. You can't check in person, can't see subtle changes, can't be there when needed. Remote monitoring doesn't replace presence—but it provides visibility that transforms long-distance caregiving.

## The Long-Distance Challenge

### What Distance Creates

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Can't observe directly | Miss visual cues |
| Phone calls limited | Only hear what they say |
| Visits infrequent | Miss gradual changes |
| Emergency response | Can't get there quickly |
| Coordination difficult | Managing from afar |

### Common Fears

| Fear | Worry |
|------|-------|
| Undetected decline | "What if they're getting worse?" |
| Falls without help | "What if they fall and can't call?" |
| Medical emergency | "Would I even know?" |
| Loneliness | "Are they isolated?" |
| Independence loss | "Should they still live alone?" |

### Distance Bridged
