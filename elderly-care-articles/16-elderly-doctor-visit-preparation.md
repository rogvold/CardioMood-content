## Introduction

A typical doctor visit relies on memory: "How have you been feeling? Any changes?" Memory is unreliable. Continuous monitoring transforms these conversations—arriving with weeks of objective data changes what doctors can see and do.

## The Traditional Visit Problem

### What Typically Happens

| Step | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| "How are you?" | Subjective, momentary |
| "Any changes?" | Depends on memory |
| Vital check | That moment only |
| Physical exam | Current state |
| Assessment | Based on limited data |

### Information Gaps

| Missing | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Sleep patterns | Not assessed |
| Activity trends | Not known |
| Vital sign trends | No history |
| Symptom patterns | Not recalled |
| Day-to-day variation | Invisible |

---

## What Data Adds

### Available Information

| Data Type | Insight |
|-----------|---------|
| Sleep quality trends | Weeks of rest patterns |
| Activity levels | Daily movement data |
| Heart rate trends | Resting HR over time |
| HRV patterns | Stress and recovery |
| Comparative analysis | Change from baseline |

### Better Conversations

| Without Data | With Data |
|--------------|-----------|
| "I've been tired" | "Sleep efficiency dropped 20% over 3 weeks" |
| "Seems okay" | "Activity level stable, no concerning trends" |
| "Maybe less active" | "Daily steps down 35% since last visit" |
| "Something's different" | "HRV declining, resting HR up 8 bpm" |

## Preparing for Appointments

### Before the Visit

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|

### Information to Prepare

| Category | Include |
|----------|---------|

---

## During the Appointment

### Presenting Data

| Approach | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| Lead with concerns | "I've noticed these patterns..." |
| Share summary | Hand over or show report |
| Ask specific questions | "What might explain this trend?" |
| Request interpretation | "Should we be concerned about X?" |

### Doctor Collaboration

| Opportunity | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Review together | Shared understanding |
| Correlate with symptoms | Connect data to experience |
| Adjust treatment | Based on objective response |
| Set monitoring targets | What to watch going forward |

## Types of Insights

### Treatment Monitoring

### Condition Tracking

## After the Visit

### Documentation
