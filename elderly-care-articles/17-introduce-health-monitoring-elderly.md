## Introduction

"Mom, I want to put a tracker on you" is not going to work. Introducing health monitoring requires sensitivity to autonomy, pride, and fear. Done right, parents see it as a tool for independence. Done wrong, it feels like surveillance.

## Understanding Resistance

### Common Concerns

| Concern | What They Think |
|---------|-----------------|
| Surveillance | "They're watching my every move" |
| Loss of privacy | "This is too personal" |
| Admission of decline | "I don't need this yet" |
| Technology fear | "I can't use these things" |
| Control loss | "They're taking over" |

### Underlying Fears

| Fear | Real Concern |
|------|--------------|
| Being a burden | "I don't want to worry them" |
| Losing independence | "Will this lead to a nursing home?" |
| Being treated as incapable | "I'm not that old" |
| Change | "I don't like new things" |

---

## Framing the Conversation

### What Works

| Approach | Why |
|----------|-----|
| About independence | Enables staying home |
| About your peace of mind | Helps you, not just them |
| About partnership | Working together |
| About information | Knowledge for better care |

### What Doesn't Work

| Approach | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| "You need watching" | Feels infantilizing |
| "You're getting old" | Offensive |
| "This is for your safety" | Implies inability |
| "We're worried" | Creates guilt |

---

## Conversation Starters

### Effective Openings

| Situation | Opening |
|-----------|---------|
| General discussion | "I read about something that might help us both feel better about you staying home..." |
| After an incident | "I've been thinking about how we can make sure this doesn't happen again..." |
| Distance challenge | "Being far away, I worry. This might help me worry less..." |
| Doctor recommendation | "The doctor mentioned something that might help track your health..." |

### Key Messages

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| "This keeps you home" | Independence focus |
| "I'll worry less" | About your needs |
| "You'll know more too" | Their benefit |
| "It's just information" | Low-stakes framing |

---

## Addressing Concerns

### Privacy Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "You'll see everything" | "I only see health summary, not details" |
| "It's invasive" | "You control what's shared" |
| "I don't want tracking" | "It's health monitoring, not location tracking" |

### Technology Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "I can't use tech" | "It's just like wearing a watch" |
| "Too complicated" | "Set it up once and forget it" |
| "I'll break it" | "They're designed to be simple" |

### Independence Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "I'm fine" | "This helps you stay fine, at home" |
| "Don't need it yet" | "Best to have it before you need it" |
| "Leading to nursing home" | "Opposite—this keeps you home longer" |

---

## Involving Them

### Shared Decisions

| Decision | Their Input |
|----------|-------------|
| Device choice | "Which style do you prefer?" |
| Alert settings | "Who should be notified?" |
| Data sharing | "What feels comfortable to share?" |
| Check-in frequency | "How often should I look?" |

### Showing Value to Them

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Health insights | "You'll learn about your own patterns" |
| Better doctor visits | "More information for appointments" |
| Early warning | "Catch things before they become problems" |
| Peace of mind | "Know you're okay too" |

---

## Trial Approach

### Pilot Proposal

| Element | Framing |
|---------|---------|
| Time-limited | "Let's try it for a month" |
| Evaluation | "We'll decide together if it helps" |
| Adjustable | "We can change settings if needed" |
| Reversible | "You can stop anytime" |

### Building Acceptance

| Phase | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| First week | Help with any issues |
| Second week | Point out interesting insights |
| Third week | Discuss what you've learned |
| End of trial | Evaluate together |
