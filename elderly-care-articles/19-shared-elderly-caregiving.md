## Introduction

Sibling caregiving conflicts are legendary: one sibling does more, another lives far away, someone feels uninformed. Shared access to parent health data transforms this dynamic—same information, reduced assumptions, and a basis for fair coordination.

## Common Sibling Dynamics

### Typical Tensions

| Tension | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| Unequal burden | One sibling does more |
| Information asymmetry | Some know more than others |
| Different opinions | Disagree on care approach |
| Guilt and resentment | Complex emotions |
| Geographic differences | Near vs. far |

### What Causes Conflict

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Subjective observations | "I saw Mom and she seemed..." |
| Different standards | "You think that's okay?" |
| Assumptions about others | "They don't care" |
| Historical family patterns | Old dynamics resurface |

## How Shared Data Helps

### Everyone Sees the Same Thing

| Without Shared Data | With Shared Data |
|--------------------|------------------|
| "Mom told me she's fine" | Dashboard shows objective status |
| "You don't see what I see" | We all see the same data |
| "Things are worse/better" | Trends speak for themselves |
| "I think..." | "The data shows..." |

### Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Objective baseline | Reduces opinion conflicts |
| Equal information | No one's "in the dark" |
| Documented patterns | History available |
| Shared alerts | Everyone notified together |

## Setting Up Shared Access

### Configuration

| Decision | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| Who gets access | All involved siblings |
| Alert routing | Who gets notified for what |
| Primary contact | For emergencies |

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Primary coordinator | Day-to-day oversight |

## Fair Division

### Matching Contributions to Capacity

| Sibling Situation | Possible Contribution |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Nearby, available | Doctor visits, in-person checks |
| Far away | Daily dashboard monitoring |
| Limited time | Weekend coverage |
| Medical background | Health data interpretation |
| Financial capacity | Equipment, service costs |

### Recognizing All Contributions

| Contribution Type | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| In-person care | Essential hands-on |
| Remote monitoring | Reduces burden on local sibling |
| Financial support | Enables services |
