| Trend | Direction matters more than absolute |

### Resting Heart Rate

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| What it is | Heart rate at rest |
| Normal range | Individual baseline varies |
| Higher than usual | Possible stress, illness |
| Lower than usual | Usually fine, unless extreme |

### Sleep Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Duration | Total hours slept |
| Efficiency | Time asleep vs. in bed |
| Deep sleep | Restorative percentage |
| Wake episodes | Sleep fragmentation |

### Activity Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Steps | Daily movement |
| Active minutes | Sustained activity |
| Sedentary time | Time without movement |
| Pattern | Consistency day-to-day |

## Reading Trends

|---------|---------|
| Stable trend | Normal, consistent |
| Gradual decline | Possible concern, monitor |

## When to Be Concerned

### Warning Patterns

| Pattern | Concern Level |
|---------|---------------|
| 5-10% deviation | Monitor, not urgent |
| 10-15% deviation | Check in, evaluate |
| >15% deviation | Contact doctor |
| Multiple metrics | More significant |
| Sustained change | Not just a day or two |

### Context Matters
