## Introduction

Sleep apnea affects 30-50% of seniors, yet most cases go undiagnosed. Traditional sleep studies are expensive, inconvenient, and often uncomfortable for elderly patients. Wearable devices can screen for apnea at home, identifying those who need treatment.

## Sleep Apnea in the Elderly

### Prevalence and Impact

| Factor | Data |
|--------|------|
| Prevalence in 65+ | 30-50% |
| Undiagnosed | Majority |
| Cognitive impact | Increases dementia risk 2x |
| Cardiovascular risk | Significant elevation |
| Quality of life | Daytime fatigue, poor function |

### Symptoms Often Missed

| Symptom | Why Missed |
|---------|-----------|
| Snoring | "Normal for age" |
| Daytime sleepiness | "Just getting older" |
| Morning headaches | Attributed to other causes |
| Cognitive decline | Assumed to be aging |
| Nighttime awakening | Thought to be normal |

---

## Traditional Detection

### Sleep Study (Polysomnography)

| Aspect | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| Location | Sleep lab, unfamiliar |
| Cost | $1,000-5,000 |
| Availability | Weeks/months wait |
| Comfort | Wires, sensors, strange bed |
| Accuracy | "First-night effect" |

### Barriers for Elderly

| Barrier | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Transportation | Getting to sleep lab |
| Confusion | Unfamiliar environment |
| Discomfort | Can't sleep with equipment |
| Cost | Insurance may not cover |
| Fear | Medical anxiety |

---

## Wearable Detection

### How It Works

| Technology | Capability |
|------------|------------|
| Heart rate patterns | Detects apnea-related changes |
| HRV analysis | Identifies breathing events |
| Oxygen estimation | Some devices measure SpO2 |
| Movement detection | Tracks restlessness |
| Breathing patterns | Infers respiratory events |

### Detection Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Periodic HR drops | Possible breathing pauses |
| HRV pattern changes | Respiratory event signatures |
| Frequent micro-arousals | Sleep fragmentation |
| Desaturation events | Oxygen drops |

---

## Screening vs. Diagnosis

### What Wearables Can Do

| Capability | Appropriate Use |
|------------|-----------------|
| Screening | Identify likely cases |
| Severity estimation | Mild/moderate/severe |
| Trend tracking | Monitor over time |
| Treatment monitoring | See if CPAP helps |

### What Still Needs Sleep Study

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Definitive diagnosis | Clinical standard |
| CPAP prescription | Required for insurance |
| Complex cases | Need full polysomnography |
| Central apnea | Distinguish from obstructive |

---

## Clinical Value

### Screening Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Accessible | At-home, every night |
| Affordable | Fraction of sleep study cost |
| Comfortable | Normal bed, normal sleep |
| Continuous | Multiple nights of data |

### Care Pathway

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Wearable screening |
| 2 | Positive screen → doctor |
| 3 | Confirmation study if needed |
| 4 | Treatment initiation |
| 5 | Wearable treatment monitoring |

---

## For Caregivers

### What to Watch For

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Sleep data shows pattern | Discuss with doctor |
| Daytime sleepiness + poor sleep data | Apnea screening |
| Repeated nighttime HRV drops | Possible breathing events |
| Sleep quality score declining | Evaluate causes |

### Conversation with Doctor

| Share | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Sleep score trends | Objective data |
| Nighttime patterns | Specific observations |
| Symptoms observed | Snoring, gasping |
| Family history | Risk factors |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Apnea is common:** 30-50% of seniors affected
2. **Usually undiagnosed:** Majority not detected
3. **Consequences serious:** Cognitive, cardiac risk
4. **Wearables can screen:** Accessible, affordable
5. **Not replacement:** Still need formal diagnosis
6. **Pathway to care:** Screen → doctor → study if needed
7. **Treatment monitoring:** Track if CPAP works
8. **Quality of life:** Treating apnea helps
