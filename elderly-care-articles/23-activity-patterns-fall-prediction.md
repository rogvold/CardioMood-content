## Introduction

Falls don't come out of nowhere—activity patterns change days to weeks beforehand. Reduced daily steps, slower movement, increased sedentary time: these signals predict elevated fall risk. Monitoring these patterns enables intervention before falls happen.

## The Science of Fall Prediction

### Research Findings

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Gerontology research | Gait changes precede falls by weeks |
| BMC Geriatrics | 40% fall reduction with monitoring |
| Activity analysis | Step decline predicts falls |
| Movement studies | Speed reduction indicates risk |

### Why Patterns Change

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Strength decline | Reduced activity |
| Balance issues | More cautious movement |
| Fatigue | Less sustained activity |
| Pain | Avoiding movement |
| Illness | Systemic impact |

---

## Key Predictive Patterns

### Activity Volume

| Pattern | Risk Indication |
|---------|-----------------|
| Daily step decline | Mobility decreasing |
| Active minutes reduction | Less sustained movement |
| Range of movement narrowing | Staying closer to home |
| Activity becoming erratic | Inconsistent function |

### Activity Quality

| Pattern | Risk Indication |
|---------|-----------------|
| Slower walking speed | Balance/strength issues |
| Shorter activity bouts | Reduced endurance |
| More rest breaks | Fatigue |
| Avoiding stairs/obstacles | Compensating |

### Temporal Patterns

| Pattern | Risk Indication |
|---------|-----------------|
| Morning activity delay | Slow to get going |
| Evening activity earlier | Tiring faster |
| Nighttime activity increase | Sleep disruption, confusion |
| Weekend inactivity | Sustained low function |

## Monitoring for Fall Risk

### What to Track

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Daily steps | Overall activity volume |
| Step variability | Consistency day-to-day |
| Active minutes | Sustained movement |
| Sedentary periods | Prolonged inactivity |
| Activity timing | When they move |

### Alert Thresholds

| Decline | Concern Level |
|---------|---------------|
| 10-20% | Monitor closely |
| 20-30% | Check in, evaluate |
| >30% | Medical evaluation |
| Sudden drop | Immediate attention |

---

## Intervention Before Falls

### When Patterns Indicate Risk

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Check in with parent | Understand cause |
| Doctor consultation | Evaluate underlying issues |
| Physical therapy | Improve strength/balance |
| Home evaluation | Address hazards |
| Medication review | Check for side effects |

### Prevention Strategies

| Strategy | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Strength training | Improves muscle function |
| Balance exercises | Reduces fall risk |
| Home modifications | Removes hazards |
| Vision correction | Improves navigation |
| Footwear check | Better stability |

---

## Combining Indicators

### Activity + Other Metrics

| Combination | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| Activity down + sleep poor | Possible illness |
| Activity down + HRV low | Systemic decline |
| Activity down + morning delay | Fatigue/depression |
| Multiple declining trends | Significant concern |

### Stronger Predictions

| Approach | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| Activity alone | Good |
| Activity + sleep | Better |
| Activity + HRV + sleep | Best |
| Longitudinal trends | Most reliable |

---

## Family Application

### Daily Monitoring

| Check | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Today's steps | Quick activity status |
| Week trend | Pattern visibility |
| Comparison to baseline | Meaningful change |
| Combined view | Multiple indicators |

### Action Decisions

| Observation | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| Slight decline | Note, monitor |
| Pattern emerging | Check in |
| Significant change | Doctor visit |
| Combined concerns | Urgent evaluation |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Falls are predictable:** Patterns change before falls
2. **40% prevention possible:** With monitoring and intervention
3. **Multiple indicators:** Steps, speed, timing
4. **Days to weeks warning:** Time to act
5. **Combine metrics:** Activity + sleep + HRV
6. **Intervention works:** PT, home mods, medical review
7. **Family visibility:** See patterns as they emerge
8. **Prevention > reaction:** Act before falls happen
