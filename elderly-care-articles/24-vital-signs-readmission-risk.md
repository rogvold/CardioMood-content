## Introduction

30-day hospital readmission rates for seniors range from 15-25%. Most are preventable—the warning signs appear in the days before readmission. Continuous vital sign monitoring catches these early, enabling intervention before crisis.

## The Readmission Problem

### Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| 30-day readmission rate | 15-25% for elderly |
| Average readmission cost | $15,000-30,000 |
| Preventable percentage | 50-75% |
| Medicare penalty | Hospitals penalized |

### Why Readmissions Happen

| Cause | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Medication issues | 20-30% |
| Infection | 15-25% |
| Cardiac decompensation | 15-20% |
| Falls/injuries | 10-15% |
| Failure to follow up | 10-15% |

---

## Post-Discharge Vulnerability

### Critical Period

| Period | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| Days 1-7 | Highest risk |
| Days 8-14 | Elevated risk |
| Days 15-21 | Moderate risk |
| Days 22-30 | Continued vigilance |

### Why Vulnerability

| Factor | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Weakened state | Not fully recovered |
| Transition gaps | Care continuity breaks |
| Medication changes | Adjustment period |
| Limited monitoring | Between discharge and follow-up |
| Patient confusion | New instructions |

---

## Vital Signs as Predictors

### Early Warning Indicators

| Vital Sign Change | Possible Issue |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Rising heart rate | Infection, dehydration, cardiac stress |
| Declining HRV | Systemic deterioration |
| Reduced activity | Weakness, decline |
| Poor sleep | Pain, anxiety, decompensation |
| Elevated resting HR | Body fighting problem |

### Detection Timeline

| Days Before Readmission | Detectable Change |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| 3-5 days | HRV declining |
| 2-4 days | HR elevated |
| 1-3 days | Activity reduced |
| 1-2 days | Sleep disrupted |

---

## Monitoring Post-Discharge

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Heart rate trend | Cardiac/infection detection |
| HRV pattern | Systemic status |
| Activity level | Functional recovery |
| Sleep quality | Restorative capacity |
| Comparison to discharge | Recovery trajectory |

### Alert Configuration

| Alert Type | Trigger |
|------------|---------|
| Vital sign elevation | Above expected recovery |
| Declining trend | Not improving as expected |
| Activity reduction | Less than post-discharge baseline |
| Combined indicators | Multiple concerning signals |

---

## Intervention Pathway

### When Alerts Appear

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Review vital sign trends |
| 2 | Contact patient/family |
| 3 | Evaluate symptoms |
| 4 | Decide: doctor visit or ER |
| 5 | Coordinate with discharge team |

### Prevention Actions

| Intervention | Goal |
|--------------|------|
| Medication adjustment | Address issue early |
| Doctor visit | Evaluate in office |
| Home health visit | Assess in person |
| Lifestyle modification | Support recovery |

---

## Clinical Value

### For Healthcare Teams

| Application | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Discharge monitoring | Visibility into recovery |
| Risk stratification | Target high-risk patients |
| Transition care | Bridge discharge gap |
| Quality metrics | Reduce readmission rates |

### For Families

| Application | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Recovery visibility | See how they're doing |
| Early warning | Know before crisis |
| Peace of mind | Confidence in recovery |
| Doctor communication | Data for check-ups |
