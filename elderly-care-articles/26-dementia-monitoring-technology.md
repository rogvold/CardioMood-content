## Introduction

Dementia progression isn't steady—it fluctuates, sometimes rapidly. Changes in sleep, activity, and vital signs often signal cognitive shifts before behavior changes become obvious. Monitoring provides objective tracking that supplements caregiver observations.

## Dementia's Variable Course

### Pattern Changes

| What Changes | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Sleep-wake cycle | Disruption common |
| Activity patterns | May decrease or become erratic |
| Nighttime behavior | Wandering, restlessness |
| Daily routines | Becoming inconsistent |
| Vital sign patterns | Reflect overall stress |

### Why Detection Matters

| Early Detection | Benefit |
|-----------------|---------|
| Medication adjustment | Optimize treatment |
| Safety intervention | Before incidents |
| Care planning | Prepare for changes |
| Family awareness | Understand progression |

## What Monitoring Reveals

### Sleep Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Reversed sleep-wake | Day/night confusion |
| Frequent awakening | Disrupted cognition |
| Early morning waking | Common in dementia |
| Napping increase | Energy/cognition decline |

### Activity Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Reduced overall activity | Cognitive decline |
| Erratic patterns | Executive function issues |
| Time-of-day changes | Sundowning |
| Nighttime activity | Wandering risk |

### Vital Signs

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Elevated resting HR | Agitation, stress |
| Low HRV | Autonomic dysfunction |
| Pattern instability | Systemic impact of disease |

## Safety Applications

### Wandering Detection

| Technology | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Activity monitoring | Nighttime movement alerts |
| Pattern recognition | Unusual behavior detection |
| Time-based alerts | Activity at unexpected times |

### Fall Prevention

| Monitoring | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Activity decline | Mobility risk |
| Nighttime activity | High-risk period |
| Pattern changes | Intervention triggers |

### Health Crisis Prevention

| Monitoring | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Vital signs | Illness detection |
| Sleep disruption | Health changes |
| Combined patterns | Systemic concerns |

---

## Supporting Caregivers

### Objective Data

| Without Data | With Data |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Seems more confused" | "Activity 30% down this week" |
| "Maybe sleeping worse" | "Sleep efficiency dropped to 60%" |
| "Something's different" | "Three nights of nighttime activity" |

### Care Decisions

| Data | Decision Support |
|------|------------------|
| Documented decline | Care level adjustment |
| Pattern changes | Medication discussion |
| Safety concerns | Environmental changes |
| Trajectory tracking | Future planning |

---

## Communication Value

### Doctor Visits

| Bring | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Sleep trends | Objective cognition indicator |
| Activity patterns | Functional status |
| Vital sign data | Overall health |
| Specific observations | Concrete examples |

### Care Team Coordination

| Share | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Daily patterns | Consistent approach |
| Alert thresholds | Everyone aware |
| Trend data | Care plan updates |

---

## Family Support

### Managing Worry

| Monitoring Provides | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| Visibility | Know status |
| Night alerts | Wandering awareness |
| Pattern context | Understand changes |
| Documentation | Track progression |

### Decision Support

| When | Use Data For |
|------|--------------|
| Care level decisions | Objective evidence |
| Medication changes | Before/after comparison |
| Safety interventions | Documented concerns |
| Family discussions | Shared information |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dementia fluctuates:** Patterns change over time
2. **Sleep is key indicator:** Often first to change
3. **Activity patterns matter:** Reflect cognitive state
4. **Safety applications:** Wandering, falls, health
5. **Objective data:** Supplements observation
6. **Caregiver support:** Information reduces burden
7. **Doctor communication:** Better appointments
8. **Care planning:** Data-informed decisions
