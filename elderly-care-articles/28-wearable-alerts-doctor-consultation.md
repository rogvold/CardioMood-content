## Introduction

Your parent's health monitoring generates an alert. Should you call the doctor? Not every alert needs medical attention, but some definitely do. Knowing the difference prevents both over-reaction and dangerous delay.

## Alert Response Framework

### General Principles

| Principle | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Context matters | Consider circumstances |
| Trends over snapshots | Pattern more meaningful |
| Combined signals | Multiple indicators more serious |
| Know baselines | Understand their normal |
| Trust the system | Designed for meaningful alerts |

### When NOT to Call

| Situation | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Single minor deviation | Normal variation |
| Expected after activity | Appropriate response |
| Returns to normal quickly | Self-correcting |
| Known cause | Travel, illness, etc. |
| Attention-level alert | Designed for watching |

## When to Call

### Definite Doctor Call Situations

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Alert-level notification | System says it's significant |

| Combined with symptoms | Data + feeling unwell |
| Significant deviation | >15% from baseline |

### Urgent Care/ER Situations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Urgent-level alert | Immediate attention |
| Critical vital signs | Seek emergency care |
| Unable to reach parent | Check in person |
