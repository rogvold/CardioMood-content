## Introduction

Wearable data is most valuable when it flows into clinical care. EHR integration brings continuous monitoring data where clinicians can use it: in the electronic health record alongside other patient information. This connection transforms wearables from consumer gadgets to clinical tools.

## Why Integration Matters

### Current Gap

| Without Integration | Problem |
|--------------------|---------|
| Data in separate app | Clinician doesn't see it |
| Patient brings printouts | May not happen |
| Disconnected from care | Lost opportunity |
| No clinical workflow | Extra burden |

### With Integration

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Data in EHR | Available at point of care |
| Clinical workflow | Part of normal process |
| Longitudinal view | With other patient data |
| Decision support | Informs clinical judgment |

---

## Integration Types

### Data Sharing Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Summary reports | Periodic summary to record |
| Trend data | Key metrics over time |
| Alert integration | Significant events flagged |
| Continuous stream | Real-time data flow |

### Technical Approaches

| Approach | Method |
|----------|--------|
| FHIR API | Modern health data standard |
| Direct integration | Platform-to-EHR connection |
| Patient portal | Patient-accessible sharing |
| Third-party aggregator | Intermediary service |
