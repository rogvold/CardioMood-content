## Introduction

Life insurance underwriting hasn't fundamentally changed in decades.

Collect application data. Order medical exam. Review health history. Assign risk class. Price policy.

**This model assumes health is static.** It isn't.

The policyholder who passes underwriting today may be on a declining health trajectory. The one flagged as higher risk may be actively improving. Traditional underwriting can't tell the difference.

Continuous biometric monitoring changes this equation entirely. Instead of a single assessment, insurers gain an ongoing window into policyholder health—enabling dynamic risk assessment, earlier intervention, and unprecedented pricing accuracy.

This article explores how continuous monitoring is reshaping life insurance underwriting from the ground up.

## The Traditional Underwriting Problem

### The Single-Moment Assessment

Traditional life insurance underwriting evaluates health at one point in time:

| Traditional Data | What It Shows | What It Misses |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Medical exam | Current health status | Health trajectory |
| Blood work | Point-in-time markers | Daily variations |
| Health questionnaire | Self-reported history | Unreported conditions |
| Prescription history | Known treatments | Emerging issues |
| MIB check | Prior applications | Current developments |

**The fundamental limitation:** By the time the policy is issued, the underwriting data is already outdated.

### The Trajectory Blindspot

Consider two applicants with identical underwriting profiles:

**Applicant A:**
- Blood pressure: 128/82
- BMI: 27
- Cholesterol: Normal
- Non-smoker
- No prescriptions

**Applicant B:**
- Blood pressure: 128/82
- BMI: 27
- Cholesterol: Normal
- Non-smoker
- No prescriptions

Traditional underwriting assigns them identical risk classes.

**But continuous monitoring reveals:**

**Applicant A (Improving):**
- HRV trending upward 15% over 6 months
- Sleep quality improving
- Stress levels declining
- Active lifestyle increasing

**Applicant B (Declining):**
- HRV trending downward 20% over 6 months
- Sleep quality deteriorating
- Chronic stress patterns
- Activity levels declining

**Same snapshot. Opposite trajectories. Vastly different claim probabilities.**

## What Continuous Monitoring Enables

### Dynamic Risk Assessment

Instead of a single risk classification at policy issue, continuous monitoring enables:

| Traditional Model | Continuous Model |
|------------------|------------------|
| Risk class assigned once | Risk score updates regularly |
| Based on point-in-time data | Based on health trajectory |
| Reassessed at renewal (if at all) | Ongoing assessment |
| Reactive to claims | Proactive to emerging risk |

### The Data Transformation

**Volume of data:**
- Traditional underwriting: ~50 data points
- Continuous monitoring: ~50 million data points per year

**Types of data:**

| Metric | Insurance Relevance |
|--------|-------------------|
| Heart rate variability | Cardiovascular risk, stress, longevity predictor |
| Sleep architecture | Metabolic health, cognitive function, mortality risk |
| Resting heart rate trends | Fitness, cardiac health, illness detection |
| Activity patterns | Lifestyle risk factors, sedentary disease risk |
| Stress biomarkers | Mental health, cardiovascular risk, burnout |
| Recovery capacity | Overall health resilience, aging trajectory |

### From Snapshots to Streams

**Traditional model:** Photograph of health
**Continuous model:** Video of health

The difference is transformative:
- See conditions developing, not just existing
- Identify risks before they become claims
- Price based on trajectory, not just current state
- Intervene during the window when intervention works

## Applications Across the Policy Lifecycle

### At Application: Accelerated Underwriting

**Traditional process:**
1. Application submitted
2. Medical exam scheduled (days/weeks)
3. Lab work processed (days)
4. Underwriter review (days/weeks)
5. Decision issued
**Timeline: 4-8 weeks**

**Continuous monitoring-enhanced process:**
1. Application submitted
2. 14-30 day baseline monitoring period
3. Automated risk scoring with ML models
4. Underwriter review of flagged cases only
5. Decision issued
**Timeline: 2-4 weeks, with richer data**

**Benefit:** Faster decisions with more accurate risk assessment.

### At Issue: Personalized Pricing

With continuous baseline data, policies can be priced based on:
- Individual health trajectory (not just current state)
- Verified lifestyle factors (not just self-reported)
- Engagement likelihood (participation predicts outcomes)

**Result:** Healthier policyholders get better rates. Higher-risk applicants are priced accurately.

### Post-Issue: Ongoing Risk Management

**Traditional approach:** No visibility until claim

**Continuous monitoring approach:**
- Quarterly risk score updates
- Early warning alerts for trajectory changes
- Proactive wellness intervention triggers
- Dynamic engagement based on health patterns

### At Renewal: Trajectory-Based Repricing

**Traditional renewal:** Based on age and original risk class

**Continuous monitoring renewal:**
- Actual health data over policy period
- Demonstrated lifestyle and engagement
- Trajectory-based pricing adjustment
- Rewards for health improvement
