## Introduction

Traditional underwriting asks: "What happens to people like this applicant?"

Precision underwriting asks: "What's happening to this specific applicant?"

The difference seems subtle. The implications are transformative.

Population-based underwriting—the foundation of insurance pricing for over a century—groups individuals into categories and applies average risk factors. It works well enough at portfolio scale, but it systematically misprices individual risk.

**Precision underwriting changes the equation** by assessing individuals based on their own data—their actual health trajectory, verified behaviors, and personal physiology.

This article explores the shift from population averages to individual trajectories, and why it represents the future of insurance risk assessment.

## The Limitations of Population-Based Underwriting

### How Traditional Underwriting Works

**Step 1:** Collect applicant information
- Age, gender, location
- Height, weight, BMI
- Medical history
- Family history
- Lifestyle questionnaire

**Step 2:** Assign to risk class based on population tables
- Preferred Plus
- Preferred
- Standard Plus
- Standard
- Substandard (rated)

**Step 3:** Apply population-average pricing
- Each class has mortality/morbidity rates
- Rates derived from historical population data
- Individual priced at class average

### The Fundamental Problem

**Within each risk class, there's massive individual variation.**

Consider 100 applicants assigned to "Standard" risk class:
- Some are trending toward Preferred (improving health)
- Some are stable at Standard
- Some are trending toward Substandard (declining health)

**Population pricing treats them identically.**

The result:
- Improving-health individuals are overcharged → competitive vulnerability
- Declining-health individuals are undercharged → claims losses
- "Average" pricing is wrong for almost everyone

### The Self-Reported Data Problem

Traditional underwriting relies heavily on self-reported information:

| Question | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "Do you exercise regularly?" | Overestimated by 50%+ |
| "How many drinks per week?" | Underestimated by 30-50% |
| "Rate your stress level" | Poor self-awareness |
| "How many hours do you sleep?" | Overestimated by 30+ min |

**People don't lie (usually). They just don't know.**

Self-perception diverges significantly from objective measurement. Underwriting based on self-reported data inherits these inaccuracies.

## What Precision Underwriting Looks Like

### Individual Data, Individual Pricing

**Instead of:** "55-year-old males with BMI 28 have X mortality rate"

**Precision approach:** "This specific 55-year-old male shows:
- HRV trending upward (improving cardiovascular health)
- Sleep quality: 88th percentile for age
- Activity level: Verified 8,000+ steps daily
- Stress patterns: Well-managed, good recovery
- Trajectory: Improving over past 6 months"

**Pricing:** Based on THIS individual's demonstrated health trajectory, not population average.

### The Data That Enables Precision

| Data Type | Population Approach | Precision Approach |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Heart health | BMI, blood pressure reading | Continuous HRV, HR trends |
| Activity | Self-reported exercise | Verified daily activity data |
| Sleep | "Do you sleep 7-8 hours?" | Actual sleep stages, quality, consistency |
| Stress | "Are you stressed?" | Objective stress biomarkers, patterns |
| Lifestyle | Questionnaire responses | Behavioral verification through data |

### The Trajectory Advantage

**Population approach:** Assesses current state
**Precision approach:** Assesses direction of travel

| Current State | Trajectory | Population Risk | Precision Risk |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Moderate health | Improving | Standard | Better than Standard |
| Moderate health | Stable | Standard | Standard |
| Moderate health | Declining | Standard | Worse than Standard |

**Same population category. Three different actual risks. Precision pricing captures the difference.**

## The Business Case for Precision Underwriting

### Competitive Advantage with Healthy Lives

**The adverse selection problem:**
Traditional carriers offer the same price to everyone in a risk class. Healthy individuals within that class are overcharged relative to their actual risk.

**What happens:**
- Healthy customers shop for better rates
- Precision-enabled carriers identify them and offer lower prices
- Healthy customers migrate to precision carriers
- Traditional carriers are left with adverse-selected book

**The precision advantage:**
Carriers using individual data can accurately price healthy lives, attracting the best risks while maintaining profitability.

### Accurate Pricing for Elevated Risks

**Conversely:** Precision underwriting identifies individuals whose trajectory suggests higher risk than their population category implies.

**Options:**
- Price appropriately (higher premium)
- Decline coverage
- Offer wellness intervention
- Monitor and adjust at renewal

**Outcome:** Avoid systematic underpricing of deteriorating risks.

### The Portfolio Effect

**Over 100,000 policies:**

| Approach | Healthy Lives | Elevated Risks | Portfolio |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Population | Overpriced (some leave) | Underpriced (stay) | Adverse selection |
| Precision | Accurately priced (stay) | Accurately priced | Optimal selection |

**The precision carrier builds a better book** by attracting accurately-priced healthy lives and appropriately pricing elevated risks.

## Case Example: Precision Underwriting in Action

### Two Applicants with Identical Profiles

**Traditional underwriting data (identical):**
- Female, 48 years old
- BMI: 27
- Blood pressure: 128/82
- Cholesterol: Total 205, LDL 125
- Non-smoker
- Desk job, reports "moderate exercise"
- Family history: Mother had heart disease at 70

**Traditional classification:** Standard Plus (both)

### Precision Data Reveals Differences

**Applicant A:**
- HRV: 52ms average, stable over 30 days
- Resting HR: 64 BPM, stable
- Sleep: 7.4 hours, 86% efficiency, 95 min deep sleep
- Activity: 9,200 steps/day average, regular exercise
- Stress: Moderate with good recovery

**Precision classification:** Preferred (upgraded)
**Pricing impact:** 15% lower premium

**Applicant B:**
- HRV: 31ms average, declined 18% over 30 days
- Resting HR: 72 BPM, increased 6 BPM over period
- Sleep: 6.1 hours, 71% efficiency, 42 min deep sleep
- Activity: 4,100 steps/day average, sedentary pattern
- Stress: Elevated with poor recovery

**Precision classification:** Standard (or monitor for potential rating)
**Pricing impact:** Priced appropriately for actual risk

### The Outcome Difference

**Traditional approach:**
Both applicants get identical Standard Plus pricing. Applicant A is overcharged. Applicant B is undercharged.

**Precision approach:**
Applicant A gets appropriate Preferred pricing (competitive offer). Applicant B is priced for actual risk (profitable policy or declined).

**At scale:** Precision carriers build better books through accurate individual pricing.
