## Introduction

"How many hours do you sleep?"

It's a standard underwriting question. And the answers are almost always wrong.

Research shows people overestimate sleep duration by 30-60 minutes and dramatically overrate sleep quality. More importantly, the question misses what actually matters: sleep architecture, efficiency, and disorders.

**Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of mortality**—but only when measured objectively. Self-reported sleep tells insurers almost nothing. Continuous sleep monitoring reveals everything.

This article examines the relationship between sleep and mortality, the specific metrics that predict risk, and how insurers can leverage sleep data in underwriting.

## The Sleep-Mortality Connection

### Research Findings

**Sleep duration and mortality (U-shaped relationship):**

| Sleep Duration | Mortality Risk | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| < 5 hours | +12-15% | Insufficient recovery |
| 5-6 hours | +8-10% | Still elevated |
| 7-8 hours | Baseline | Optimal range |
| 9-10 hours | +10-15% | May indicate illness |
| > 10 hours | +20-30% | Often signals underlying disease |

**Key insight:** Both too little and too much sleep predict mortality. But duration is just the beginning.

### Beyond Duration: What Really Matters

**Sleep architecture predicts outcomes better than duration:**

| Metric | Mortality Association |
|--------|----------------------|
| Deep sleep deficiency | Cardiovascular events, diabetes |
| REM sleep deficiency | Cognitive decline, depression |
| Sleep fragmentation | All-cause mortality |
| Sleep efficiency < 75% | Elevated risk across conditions |
| Untreated sleep apnea | 2-3x cardiovascular mortality |

**The person sleeping 6 hours of high-quality sleep may be healthier than someone sleeping 8 hours of fragmented sleep.**

## Self-Report vs. Objective Measurement

### The Self-Report Problem

**What applicants report vs. reality:**

| Metric | Self-Reported | Objective Measurement | Gap |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|-----|
| Sleep duration | 7.5 hours | 6.2 hours | +1.3 hours |
| Time to fall asleep | 15 minutes | 34 minutes | -19 minutes |
| Wake-ups per night | 1-2 | 6-8 | -4-6 |
| Sleep quality | "Good" | 68% efficiency | Mismatch |

**The gap isn't deception—it's perception.** People genuinely don't know how they sleep.

### The Underwriting Implication

**Traditional approach:**
- Ask "How many hours do you sleep?"
- Accept answer at face value
- Adjust slightly for age
- Move on

**Reality:**
- Self-reported data is unreliable
- Critical conditions (like sleep apnea) are missed
- Underwriting based on perception, not reality

**Objective measurement solves this.**

## Sleep Metrics for Insurance Risk Assessment

### Tier 1: Essential Metrics

**1. Total Sleep Time (Actual)**
- Measured, not estimated
- Hours of actual sleep, not time in bed
- 7-8 hours optimal for most adults

**2. Sleep Efficiency**
- Percentage of time in bed actually sleeping
- Target: 85%+
- Below 75%: Significant risk elevation

**3. Deep Sleep Duration**
- Slow-wave sleep in minutes
- Target: 90+ minutes for adults
- Below 45 minutes: Major recovery deficit

**4. Sleep Apnea Indicators**
- SpO2 drops during sleep
- Respiratory disturbance events
- Critical for cardiovascular risk

### Tier 2: Enhanced Metrics

**5. REM Sleep Duration**
- Target: 90+ minutes
- Important for cognitive and emotional health
- Low REM associated with depression

**6. Sleep Latency**
- Time to fall asleep
- Very short (< 5 min): Sleep deprivation
- Very long (> 30 min): Insomnia

**7. Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)**
- Time awake during the night
- High WASO indicates sleep maintenance issues

**8. Sleep Regularity**
- Consistency of sleep/wake times
- Irregular patterns associated with metabolic risk

## Sleep Apnea: The Hidden Risk Factor

### The Prevalence Problem

**Sleep apnea statistics:**
- Affects 25-30% of adults over 50
- 80% of cases are undiagnosed
- Strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality
- Traditional underwriting rarely detects it

### Why It Matters for Insurers

| Sleep Apnea Severity | Cardiovascular Risk Multiplier |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Mild (5-15 events/hour) | 1.3-1.5x |
| Moderate (15-30 events/hour) | 1.8-2.2x |
| Severe (30+ events/hour) | 2.5-4.0x |

**Untreated severe sleep apnea roughly quadruples cardiovascular mortality risk.**

### Detection Through Wearables

**Continuous monitoring reveals:**
- SpO2 drops during sleep (desaturation events)
- Respiratory rate patterns
- Sleep fragmentation patterns
- Heart rate responses to apnea events

**This is not diagnosis** (requires sleep study), but it identifies candidates for referral and flags elevated risk.

### Case Example

**Policyholder profile:**
- Male, 55, BMI 29
- Self-reports: "Sleep okay, 7 hours most nights"
- Traditional screening: Passes

**Continuous monitoring reveals:**
- Actual sleep: 5.8 hours
- SpO2: Drops to 82-86% repeatedly (40+ times/night)
- Sleep efficiency: 61%
- Deep sleep: 22 minutes

**Assessment:** Likely moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. Significant mortality risk undetected by traditional underwriting.

## Sleep-Related Conditions and Insurance Risk

### Type 2 Diabetes Connection

**The relationship:**
- Poor sleep disrupts glucose metabolism
- Sleep deprivation increases insulin resistance
- Diabetes risk elevated 2-3x with chronic short sleep

**For insurers:**
- Sleep patterns predict metabolic risk trajectory
- Early intervention can prevent diabetes development
- Sleep data adds to metabolic risk assessment

### Cardiovascular Disease Connection

**The relationship:**
- Sleep deprivation elevates blood pressure
- Sleep apnea causes intermittent hypoxia
- Poor sleep increases inflammatory markers
- Combined effect: Significantly elevated CV risk

**For insurers:**
- Sleep quality predicts cardiovascular claims
- Even with normal BP/cholesterol, poor sleep = risk
- Sleep is independent additive risk factor

### Mental Health Connection

**The relationship:**
- Sleep disturbance precedes depression
- REM abnormalities associated with mood disorders
- Insomnia increases suicide risk
- Bidirectional relationship (poor sleep ↔ mental health)

**For insurers:**
- Sleep patterns predict mental health claims
- Early warning of disability trajectory
- Particularly relevant for disability underwriting

## Implementing Sleep Data in Underwriting

### Data Collection Protocol

**For insurance-grade sleep assessment:**

| Requirement | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| Device capability | Sleep stage detection, SpO2 measurement |
| Collection duration | 14-30 nights minimum |
| Data quality | Motion artifact filtering, completeness checks |
| Measurement type | Continuous overnight tracking |

### Interpretation Framework

**Red flags requiring attention:**

| Finding | Risk Level | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Sleep efficiency < 70% | High | Investigate, possible rating |
| Deep sleep < 30 min consistently | High | Cardiovascular risk elevation |
| SpO2 drops below 88% repeatedly | High | Sleep apnea—refer for evaluation |
| Total sleep < 5 hours chronically | Moderate-High | Health risk elevation |
| REM < 45 min consistently | Moderate | Monitor, possible mental health concern |

### Scoring Integration

**Sample scoring approach:**

| Sleep Score | Percentile | Underwriting Implication |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 90-100 | Top 10% | Potential upgrade |
| 70-89 | Average | Standard processing |
| 50-69 | Below average | Additional scrutiny |
| < 50 | Concerning | Likely rating or decline |
