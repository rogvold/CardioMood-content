## Introduction

The economics are stark.

| Approach | Cost | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| Prevention | $500-1,000 | Condition never develops |
| Early intervention | $2,000-10,000 | Condition treated, resolved |
| Late treatment | $50,000-500,000 | Emergency care, long-term management |

For every $1 spent on early intervention, insurers save $50 in avoided treatment costs. Yet most insurance spending goes to treatment, not prevention.

This article examines the economics of intervention vs. treatment across major condition categories, explains why the healthcare system is structured backwards, and shows how insurers can profit from flipping the equation.

## The 50:1 Ratio in Practice

### Cardiovascular Disease

**Scenario 1: No Intervention**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Years 1-5 | Undetected risk factors | $0 |
| Year 6 | Heart attack | $150,000 (acute care) |
| Years 7-10 | Cardiac rehab, medications, monitoring | $50,000/year |
| Total (10 years) | | $350,000 |

**Scenario 2: Early Intervention (Risk Detected Year 1)**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Year 1 | Risk factors detected through monitoring | $500 |
| Years 1-10 | Lifestyle intervention + monitoring | $1,500/year |
| Total (10 years) | | $15,500 |

**Savings: $334,500 per prevented cardiac event (21:1 ratio)**

### Type 2 Diabetes

**Scenario 1: No Intervention**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Years 1-3 | Undetected prediabetes | $0 |
| Years 4-10 | Diabetes management | $15,000/year |
| Year 8+ | Complications (kidney, eyes, nerves) | $50,000+/year |
| Total (10 years) | | $200,000+ |

**Scenario 2: Early Intervention (Prediabetes Detected Year 1)**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Year 1 | Metabolic risk detected | $500 |
| Years 1-3 | Lifestyle program | $2,000/year |
| Years 4-10 | Maintained prevention | $500/year |
| Total (10 years) | | $10,000 |

**Savings: $190,000+ per prevented diabetes case (19:1 ratio)**

### Mental Health (Burnout to Disability)

**Scenario 1: No Intervention**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Months 1-12 | Undetected burnout development | $0 |
| Month 13 | Disability claim filed | |
| Months 13-36 | Disability payments | $5,000/month |
| Months 13-36 | Treatment costs | $2,000/month |
| Total (3 years) | | $170,000 |

**Scenario 2: Early Intervention (Burnout Detected Month 6)**

| Timeline | Event | Cost |
|----------|-------|------|
| Month 6 | Stress patterns detected | Included in monitoring |
| Months 6-12 | Stress intervention program | $3,000 |
| Outcome | Burnout prevented | $0 claims |
| Total | | $3,000 |

**Savings: $167,000 per prevented burnout disability (55:1 ratio)**

## Why the System Is Backwards

### The Payment Structure Problem

**Traditional healthcare economics:**
- Providers paid for treatment, not prevention
- Hospitals profit from filled beds
- Specialists profit from procedures
- Prevention = lost revenue for providers

**Insurance economics (should be different):**
- Insurers pay for treatment
- Prevention reduces claims
- Insurers should profit from prevention
- Yet most insurers focus on treatment management, not prevention

### The Detection Problem

**Traditional model:**
- Wait for symptoms
- Patient seeks care
- Diagnosis made
- Treatment begins
- Insurer pays

**By the time symptoms appear:**
- Condition has progressed
- Early intervention window closed
- Only treatment option remaining
- Costs are 10-50x higher

### The Incentive Misalignment

| Stakeholder | Short-term Incentive | Long-term Reality |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Provider | Treat, not prevent | N/A (paid per treatment) |
| Patient | Avoid discomfort | Worse outcomes, higher costs |
| Employer | Minimize wellness spend | Higher group claims |
| Insurer | Traditional model | Higher claims than necessary |

**Insurers are uniquely positioned to benefit from flipping this equation.**

## The Intervention Window

### What Makes Intervention Possible

**Three requirements:**
1. Early detection (before symptoms)
2. Effective intervention (proven to work)
3. Mechanism for delivery (how to reach the person)

**Continuous biometric monitoring provides #1 and #3.**

### Window Sizes by Condition

| Condition | Intervention Window | Detection Method |
|-----------|--------------------| -----------------|
| Cardiovascular event | 6-12 months | HRV decline, stress patterns |
| Type 2 diabetes | 2-5 years | Metabolic changes, activity decline |
| Burnout/depression | 3-6 months | Stress biomarkers, sleep changes |
| Hypertension | Ongoing | Blood pressure trends |
| Sleep apnea | Immediate | SpO2 monitoring |

### What Closes the Window

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Time | Condition progresses, intervention less effective |
| Severity | Acute events require treatment, not intervention |
| Complications | Secondary conditions develop |
| Psychological | Patient in crisis mode, not prevention mode |

## Intervention Economics for Insurers

### The Investment Calculation

**Question:** How much should an insurer spend on intervention?

**Answer:** Up to 50% of expected treatment cost.

**Example:**
- Expected cardiovascular claim: $150,000
- Probability of event: 5%
- Expected value: $7,500
- Economical intervention threshold: $3,750

**If intervention costs $1,000 and reduces probability by 50%:**
- New expected value: $3,750
- Savings: $3,750
- ROI: 3.75:1

### Scaling Prevention Economics

**Per 100,000 policyholders:**

| Category | At-Risk | Events (No Prevention) | Events (With Prevention) | Savings |
|----------|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Cardiovascular | 5,000 | 250 | 100 | $22.5M |
| Diabetes | 8,000 | 800 | 320 | $91.2M |
| Mental health | 10,000 | 500 | 200 | $50.1M |
| **Total** | | | | **$163.8M** |

**Investment required:** ~$30M ($300/at-risk member)
**Net savings:** $133.8M
**Portfolio ROI:** 4.5:1

## Designing Effective Interventions

### Cardiovascular Intervention Protocol

**Trigger:** HRV declining 15%+ over 8 weeks

**Intervention:**
1. Alert generated to care team
2. Outreach to member
3. Lifestyle assessment
4. Personalized intervention plan
   - Stress management program
   - Exercise prescription
   - Sleep optimization
   - Nutrition guidance
5. Ongoing monitoring
6. Escalation if not improving

**Cost:** $1,500-3,000
**Effectiveness:** 40-60% event reduction

### Metabolic Intervention Protocol

**Trigger:** Activity decline + sleep disruption + HRV pattern

**Intervention:**
1. Metabolic risk assessment
2. Lifestyle modification program
3. Nutrition counseling
4. Activity program
5. Monitoring and coaching
6. Medication referral if needed

**Cost:** $2,000-4,000
**Effectiveness:** 50-70% diabetes prevention

### Mental Health Intervention Protocol

**Trigger:** Chronic stress biomarkers (HRV, sleep, recovery)

**Intervention:**
1. Stress assessment
2. Therapeutic support (coaching or therapy)
3. Workplace intervention (if applicable)
4. Lifestyle modifications
5. Ongoing monitoring
6. Escalation pathway for severe cases

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000
**Effectiveness:** 50-70% disability prevention

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Identifying the Right People

**Problem:** Intervention only valuable for at-risk individuals
**Solution:** Biometric monitoring identifies who is actually at risk (not just demographic risk)

### Challenge 2: Reaching People Before Symptoms

**Problem:** People don't seek help for problems they don't know they have
**Solution:** Proactive outreach based on data triggers

### Challenge 3: Engagement and Compliance

**Problem:** People offered intervention don't always participate
**Solution:** Incentives, personalization, low-friction programs

### Challenge 4: Proving ROI

**Problem:** Prevention's impact is counterfactual (what didn't happen)
**Solution:** Control groups, matched cohort analysis, trend comparison
