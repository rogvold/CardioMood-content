## Introduction

The data from a wearable tells you about someone's health. How they engage with that wearable tells you about their behavior. Both matter for predicting risk.

Behavioral underwriting examines not just what policyholders' biometrics show, but how they interact with wellness programs, respond to health insights, and engage with their coverage. This engagement data often predicts claims as well as—or better than—the health data itself.

**Behavior reveals intention. Intention predicts outcomes.**

## What Is Behavioral Underwriting?

### Beyond Biometrics

**Traditional biometric underwriting asks:** What is your current health status?

**Behavioral underwriting adds:** What are you doing about your health?

| Data Type | What It Shows | Predictive Value |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Biometric | Current health state | Moderate |
| Behavioral | Health engagement patterns | High |
| Combined | State + trajectory + intention | Very High |

### Engagement as a Risk Factor

**Engagement predicts:**
- Adherence to treatment (medical claims)
- Preventive behavior (avoiding future claims)
- Health consciousness (lifestyle risk)
- Responsiveness to intervention (modifiability)

**Research finding:** High-engagement policyholders have 20-30% lower claims than low-engagement policyholders with similar biometrics.

## Types of Engagement Data

### Device Engagement

**Metrics:**
| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Wear time | Commitment to tracking |
| Charging consistency | Device importance |
| Feature usage | Health interest depth |
| App opens | Active engagement |
| Data review | Health awareness |

**Low wear time doesn't just mean less data—it signals less health engagement.**

### Program Participation

**Wellness program engagement:**

| Metric | Risk Correlation |
|--------|-----------------|
| Challenge participation | Lower claims |
| Goal completion | Lower claims |
| Coaching session attendance | Lower claims |
| Health content consumption | Lower claims |
| Assessment completion | Lower claims |

### Response to Information

**How people react to health insights:**

| Response Pattern | Risk Implication |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Increases activity after low step alert | Responsive, modifiable |
| Schedules checkup after risk notification | Preventive-minded |
| Adjusts sleep after poor sleep score | Health-conscious |
| Ignores all notifications | Disengaged, higher risk |
| Deletes app after warning | Avoidant, concerning |

---

## The Engagement-Claims Connection

### Research Evidence

**Studies show:**

| Engagement Level | Claims Difference |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Top 25% engaged | 25-35% lower claims |
| Average engagement | Baseline |
| Bottom 25% engaged | 15-25% higher claims |

**The effect persists** after controlling for biometric health status.

### Why Engagement Predicts Claims

1. **Selection effect:** Health-conscious people engage more
2. **Behavior effect:** Engagement reinforces healthy behavior
3. **Prevention effect:** Engaged people catch problems earlier
4. **Adherence effect:** Engaged people follow recommendations

### Engagement Over Time

**Engagement patterns reveal trajectory:**

| Pattern | Prediction |
|---------|-----------|
| Consistently high | Sustained low risk |
| Increasing over time | Improving risk trajectory |
| Decreasing over time | Rising risk |
| Sporadic | Variable, less predictable |
| Never engaged | Highest risk segment |

## Building Engagement Scores

### Data Sources

**Combine multiple signals:**

| Source | Metrics |
|--------|---------|
| Wearable | Wear time, sync frequency, feature use |
| App | Opens, time spent, features used |
| Portal | Logins, content viewed, tools used |
| Program | Challenges joined, goals set, completed |
| Communication | Emails opened, notifications enabled, responses |
| Services | Coaching calls, screenings, assessments |

### Scoring Methodology

**Sample engagement score calculation:**

| Component | Weight | Metrics |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Device consistency | 25% | Wear time, sync frequency |
| Active participation | 30% | Challenges, goals, programs |
| Content engagement | 20% | App opens, features used |
| Responsiveness | 15% | Notification actions, recommendations followed |
| Progress | 10% | Improvement in any metric |

### Engagement Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Highly engaged | 80-100 | Daily use, full participation |
| Engaged | 60-79 | Regular use, some participation |
| Passive | 40-59 | Occasional use, minimal participation |
| Minimal | 20-39 | Rare use, no participation |
| Disengaged | 0-19 | Device inactive, no interaction |

## Underwriting Integration

### Point-of-Sale Engagement

**Early engagement signals:**

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|------------|
| Quick app setup | Motivated |
| Device pairing on day 1 | Committed |
| Profile completion | Detail-oriented |
| Goal setting | Intentional |
| Family member addition | Social support |

### Continuous Assessment

**Ongoing engagement informs:**

| Assessment Point | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|
| 30 days post-issue | Early engagement classification |
| Renewal | Engagement-based pricing adjustment |
| Quarterly | Risk trend monitoring |
| Post-claim | Recovery engagement prediction |

### Risk Modification

**Engagement-based adjustments:**

| Engagement Level | Pricing Impact |
|-----------------|---------------|
| High engagement | 10-15% discount |
| Average engagement | Standard |
| Low engagement | May indicate hidden risk |

## Predictive Models

### Engagement-Based Risk Models

**Input features:**
- Engagement score (composite)
- Engagement trend (improving/declining)
- Engagement consistency (variance)
- Engagement breadth (multiple features vs. single)
- Time to engagement (how quickly active)

**Output:**
- Claims probability adjustment
- Engagement-adjusted risk score
- Retention probability
- Intervention opportunity score

### Model Performance

**Engagement models typically achieve:**

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Claims prediction improvement | +15-25% accuracy |
| Risk stratification lift | 2.5-3.5x at top decile |
| Early warning capability | 3-6 months ahead |
| Retention prediction | 70-80% accuracy |

## Engagement-Based Interventions

### Targeting Approach

| Engagement Segment | Intervention Strategy |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| High engagement, good metrics | Recognition, maintain |
| High engagement, concerning metrics | Coaching, resources |
| Low engagement, good metrics | Re-engage, simplify |
| Low engagement, concerning metrics | High-touch outreach |

### Re-Engagement Tactics

**For declining engagement:**
- Simplified goals
- Personalized content
- Incentive reminders
- Gamification refresh
- Coach outreach

**Success metric:** Re-engagement predicts improved outcomes.

---

## Privacy Considerations

### Transparency Requirements

**Policyholders should know:**
- Engagement data is collected
- How it affects their coverage/pricing
- How to improve engagement standing
- Their engagement status

### Ethical Boundaries

**Avoid:**
- Penalizing for non-engagement without clear disclosure
- Using engagement to deny coverage
- Invasive monitoring beyond consented scope
- Discrimination through engagement proxies

**Best practice:** Use engagement for rewards, not punishments.
