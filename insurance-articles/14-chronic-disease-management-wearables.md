## Introduction

Chronic diseases consume 86% of US healthcare spending. Diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and respiratory conditions drive claims year after year, often with preventable complications.

Traditional chronic disease management relies on periodic doctor visits—seeing a patient for 15 minutes every 3-6 months. Between visits, disease progression goes unmonitored, complications develop undetected, and opportunities for intervention are missed.

**Wearable monitoring changes this equation.**

Continuous biometric data enables daily disease tracking, early warning of deterioration, and timely intervention before complications require hospitalization. For insurers, this means dramatically lower chronic disease claims.

## The Chronic Disease Claims Burden

### Cost Concentration

**Chronic conditions dominate healthcare spending:**

| Condition | Annual US Spending | % of Total |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Cardiovascular disease | $351 billion | 12% |
| Diabetes | $327 billion | 11% |
| Mental health | $225 billion | 8% |
| Respiratory disease | $154 billion | 5% |
| Musculoskeletal | $129 billion | 4% |

### The Claims Pattern

**Chronic condition claims trajectory:**

| Phase | Claims Impact |
|-------|--------------|
| Diagnosis | Initial spike |
| Stabilization | Moderate ongoing |
| Controlled | Lower steady-state |
| Deterioration | Rising claims |
| Complication | Major claims spike |
| Hospitalization | Extreme cost |

**Key insight:** Most expensive claims occur during deterioration and complication—both often preventable with monitoring.

## How Wearables Transform Chronic Care

### From Periodic to Continuous

| Traditional Approach | Wearable-Enabled |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Quarterly A1C test | Daily glucose patterns |
| Annual stress test | Continuous cardiac monitoring |
| Symptom self-report | Objective biometric tracking |
| Reactive treatment | Proactive adjustment |
| Complications first | Early warning alerts |

### The Monitoring Advantage

**Wearables capture:**
- Daily health patterns
- Trend changes over weeks
- Correlation with lifestyle factors
- Medication effectiveness
- Early deterioration signals

---

## Early Warning Systems

### Deterioration Detection

**Wearables detect deterioration before symptoms:**

| Warning Sign | Leads Symptoms By |
|--------------|------------------|
| HRV decline | 2-3 weeks |
| Resting HR elevation | 1-2 weeks |
| Activity reduction | 2-4 weeks |
| Sleep quality decline | 1-2 weeks |
| Multi-metric convergence | Most predictive |

### Alert Triggers

**Sample alert rules:**

| Condition | Trigger | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Heart failure | Weight + HR + activity change | Care manager alert |
| Diabetes | Activity + sleep pattern change | Engagement outreach |
| COPD | HR elevation + activity decline | Nurse call |
| Hypertension | Stress + sleep disruption | Lifestyle coaching |

### Clinical Integration

**Effective early warning requires:**
- Clear alert pathways
- Clinical response protocols
- Care team access to data
- Closed-loop feedback
