## Introduction

Life insurance underwriting has long meant waiting: waiting for the medical exam, waiting for lab results, waiting for doctor's records, waiting for a decision. The average fully underwritten policy takes 4-6 weeks from application to issue.

Customers hate waiting. Carriers hate complexity. The industry has been racing toward accelerated underwriting—instant or near-instant decisions without traditional exams.

**Wearable data is the key to making accelerated underwriting work.**

---

## The Accelerated Underwriting Challenge

### What Accelerated Underwriting Requires

**For instant decisions, carriers need:**
- Sufficient data for risk assessment
- Confidence in data accuracy
- Ability to identify edge cases for traditional review
- Competitive pricing despite less information

### Traditional Trade-offs

**Without new data sources:**

| Approach | Speed | Risk Accuracy | Price |
|----------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Full underwriting | Slow | High | Competitive |
| Simplified issue | Fast | Low | Premium loaded |
| Accelerated (traditional data) | Medium | Medium | Compromise |

**The problem:** Accelerated programs using only traditional data must either accept more risk or charge more premium.

---

## Why Wearable Data Changes the Equation

### More Data, Not Less

**Traditional accelerated = less data, more risk**
**Wearable-enabled accelerated = different data, same or better accuracy**

| Data Type | Traditional Exam | Wearable Data |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Blood chemistry | Single point | N/A |
| Cardiovascular | Single BP, HR | Continuous HR, HRV |
| Fitness | Self-reported | Objective activity |
| Sleep | Not captured | Daily tracking |
| Lifestyle | Self-reported | Behavioral data |
| Trend | Not available | Weeks/months |

### The Accuracy Advantage

**Research shows wearable data can match or exceed exam accuracy for:**
- Cardiovascular risk assessment
- Fitness and mortality prediction
- Stress and lifestyle evaluation
- Trend detection (exam can't do)

**Key finding:** 30 days of wearable data predicts mortality as well as single-point blood chemistry for many populations.

## Accelerated Underwriting Models

### Model 1: Wearable Pre-Qualification

**Process:**
1. Applicant provides 30+ days of wearable data
2. Algorithm assesses for accelerated eligibility
3. Low-risk applicants get instant decision
4. Higher-risk routed to traditional underwriting

**Results:**
- 40-60% of applicants qualify for instant decision
- No increase in mortality experience
- Faster time-to-issue
- Lower underwriting costs

### Model 2: Wearable Replacement

**Process:**
1. Application submitted
2. Wearable data collected (14-30 days)
3. Risk assessment from biometrics
4. Decision issued without exam

**Advantages:**
- All applicants benefit from faster process
- More data than traditional accelerated
- Cost savings on avoided exams

### Model 3: Hybrid Approach

**Process:**
1. Initial assessment from application + wearable data
2. Tier assignment:
   - Tier 1: Instant issue
   - Tier 2: Additional data required
   - Tier 3: Traditional underwriting
3. Right-sized process for each applicant

**Benefits:**
- Optimizes speed/accuracy trade-off
- Reduces unnecessary exams
- Maintains pricing competitiveness

## Implementation Requirements

### Data Collection

**Minimum requirements:**
- 14 days of wearable data (30+ preferred)
- 80%+ wear time
- Complete heart rate, activity, sleep
- Quality-filtered data

**Data sources:**
- Applicant's existing wearable (with consent)
- Carrier-provided device (temporary or permanent)
- Partner integration (Apple Health, Google Fit, etc.)

### Risk Assessment

**Algorithm requirements:**
- Validated on mortality outcomes
- Calibrated to population
- Explains factors driving decisions
- Identifies cases for escalation

**Key metrics for assessment:**
- Resting heart rate (fitness indicator)
- HRV (cardiovascular, stress)
- Activity level (mortality predictor)
- Sleep quality (health indicator)
- Trends (trajectory)

### Decision Engine

**Integration with underwriting:**
- API for biometric risk score
- Rules for instant decision thresholds
- Escalation triggers
- Pricing adjustment factors

---

## Risk Segmentation

### Who Qualifies for Instant Decision

**Typical eligibility criteria:**

| Factor | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Age | 18-60 (varies) |
| Face amount | < $1-3M |
| Health indicators | No red flags |
| Biometric score | Top 50-70% |
| Data quality | Sufficient for assessment |

### Escalation Triggers

**Route to traditional underwriting when:**
- Biometric risk score is elevated
- Insufficient data quality
- Age/amount outside criteria
- Application answers indicate review needed
- Inconsistency between data sources

### Pricing Approach

**Accelerated programs can:**
- Maintain standard pricing (if accuracy equivalent)
- Apply small loading (0-5%) for uncertainty
- Offer discount for high-quality data (1-3%)

## Operational Benefits

### Speed to Issue

| Metric | Traditional | Accelerated with Wearables |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| Average time to decision | 4-6 weeks | 1-7 days |
| Instant decisions | 0% | 40-60% |
| Applicant drop-off | 30-40% | 10-15% |
