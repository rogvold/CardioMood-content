## Introduction

Group health pricing has long relied on demographic data and claims history. You know the employer's industry, location, and size. You know last year's claims. You project next year's costs.

Wearable data adds a new dimension: real-time population health. Before claims occur, you can see stress levels rising across a workforce, activity patterns declining, or sleep quality deteriorating. You can price based on where health is heading, not just where it's been.

**This framework outlines how to integrate wearable data into group health pricing strategy.**

## Traditional Group Health Pricing

### Current Factors

| Factor | Weight | Limitation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Group size | High | Not health-related |
| Industry | Moderate | Broad averages |
| Location | Moderate | Geographic, not individual |
| Demographics | Moderate | Age/gender proxies |
| Claims history | High | Backward-looking |
| Plan design | High | Utilization patterns |

### The Historical Problem

**Claims history is:**
- Always backward-looking
- Subject to year-to-year volatility
- Affected by random large claims
- Slow to reflect population changes

**Groups can deteriorate or improve faster than claims reflect.**

## The Wearable Data Opportunity

### New Pricing Inputs

| Wearable Data | Pricing Value |
|---------------|--------------|
| Population activity levels | Fitness/health indicator |
| Aggregate stress patterns | Mental health/burnout risk |
| Sleep quality distribution | Recovery and wellness |
| Health trend direction | Forward-looking indicator |
| Engagement levels | Wellness program value |

### From Lagging to Leading Indicators

**Traditional:** Wait for claims to see health deterioration
**Wearable-enabled:** See health trajectory before claims

| Indicator Type | Example | Timing |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Lagging | Claims filed | After event |
| Current | Medical utilization | During event |
| Leading | Declining HRV, activity | Before event |

---

## Pricing Framework

### Data Collection

**Population health metrics:**

| Metric | Collection Method |
|--------|------------------|
| Participation rate | % of employees with wearables |
| Active monitoring | % wearing regularly |
| Average activity | Steps, MVPA minutes |
| Stress distribution | Population stress scores |
| Sleep patterns | Average quality, duration |
| Trends | Month-over-month changes |

### Population Health Scoring

**Composite score calculation:**

| Component | Weight | Metrics |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Activity | 30% | Steps, active minutes |
| Stress/recovery | 25% | HRV, stress patterns |
| Sleep | 20% | Duration, quality |
| Engagement | 15% | Program participation |
| Trend | 10% | Improving vs. declining |

### Score Interpretation

| Population Score | Health Assessment | Pricing Implication |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Potential discount |
| 60-79 | Good | Standard pricing |
| 40-59 | Average | Standard pricing |
| 20-39 | Concerning | Consider loading |
| 0-19 | Poor | Significant loading |

---

## Pricing Models

### Model 1: Adjustment Factor

**Apply biometric adjustment to traditional pricing:**

Traditional Premium × Biometric Factor = Adjusted Premium

| Population Score | Factor Range |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Top quartile | 0.90-0.95 |
| Second quartile | 0.97-1.00 |
| Third quartile | 1.00-1.03 |
| Bottom quartile | 1.05-1.10 |

### Model 2: Trend-Based Pricing

**Weight recent trends more heavily:**

| Trend | Implication | Adjustment |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Improving rapidly | Claims likely to decrease | Discount |
| Stable healthy | Maintain current expectation | Neutral |
| Stable unhealthy | Claims consistent | Loading |
| Declining | Claims likely to increase | Higher loading |

### Model 3: Risk Band Refinement

**Use biometrics to place groups within bands:**

Traditional pricing assigns group to broad band → Biometric data refines position within band → More accurate pricing without band jumping

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Wellness Discount

**Incentive-based:**
- Employers adopt wellness program with wearables
- Discount for adoption (2-5%)
- Additional discount for demonstrated outcomes (2-5%)
- Total potential: 5-10% savings

**Benefits:**
- Employer incentivized
- Opt-in model
- Wellness investment offset
- Claims reduction over time

### Approach 2: Prospective Rating

**Forward-looking assessment:**
- Collect population biometric data at renewal
- Assess health trajectory
- Incorporate into pricing model
- Revisit at next renewal

**Benefits:**
- More accurate pricing
- Rewards improving populations
- Identifies concerning trends early

### Approach 3: Continuous Underwriting

**Real-time monitoring:**
- Ongoing population health tracking
- Quarterly assessments
- Mid-year adjustments if significant change
- Continuous feedback to employer

**Benefits:**
- Most responsive pricing
- Immediate intervention opportunity
- Strongest employer engagement
