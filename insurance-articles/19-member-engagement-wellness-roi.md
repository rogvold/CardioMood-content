## Introduction

The question isn't whether wellness programs can reduce claims—the research is clear that they can. The question is whether your wellness program is reducing claims.

The difference lies in engagement. A wellness program that 10% of members use provides 10% of potential value. Getting to 60% engagement changes the economics entirely.

**This article examines how to measure wellness engagement, improve participation, and prove ROI.**

## The Engagement-Outcomes Connection

### Why Engagement Matters

**Research consistently shows:**

| Engagement Level | Claims Impact | Productivity Impact |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| > 60% active | 20-30% lower claims | 15-20% higher |
| 30-60% active | 10-15% lower claims | 5-10% higher |
| < 30% active | Minimal impact | Minimal impact |

**Threshold effect:** Programs need critical mass to change culture and demonstrate results.

### Engagement Defined

**What counts as "engaged":**

| Engagement Tier | Definition |
|----------------|------------|
| Highly engaged | Daily wearable use, program participation, coaching |
| Engaged | Regular wearable use, some program activity |
| Passive | Occasional check-in, minimal program use |
| Enrolled only | Has device/app, rarely uses |
| Non-participant | Not enrolled |
