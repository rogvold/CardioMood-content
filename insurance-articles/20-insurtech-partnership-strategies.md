## Introduction

Every insurer considering biometric capabilities faces the same question: build or partner?

Building internally offers control and customization. Partnering offers speed and proven technology. Neither is universally right—the best choice depends on your strategic objectives, technical capabilities, and competitive timeline.

**This framework helps evaluate the build-vs-partner decision for biometric insurance capabilities.**
