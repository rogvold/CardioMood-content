## Introduction

Biometric data is only valuable if underwriters know how to use it.

The most sophisticated analytics platform delivers risk scores, but underwriters need to understand what those scores mean, when to trust them, and when additional review is required. They need to interpret individual metrics, recognize patterns, and integrate biometric insights with traditional underwriting factors.

**This article provides a framework for training underwriting teams on biometric data.**

## Module 1: Biometric Fundamentals

### What Wearables Measure

**Heart Rate:**
- Beats per minute (BPM)
- Resting heart rate (RHR) as fitness indicator
- Heart rate during activity
- Heart rate recovery after exercise

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**
- Variation between heartbeats
- Indicates autonomic nervous system balance
- Higher = generally healthier
- Lower = stress, cardiovascular concern

**Sleep:**
- Total duration
- Sleep stages (light, deep, REM)
- Sleep efficiency (time asleep / time in bed)
- Disruptions and waking

**Activity:**
- Steps per day
- Active minutes
- Intensity distribution
- Sedentary time

### Normal Ranges

| Metric | Normal Range | Concern Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Resting HR | 50-80 BPM | > 85 or < 40 |
| HRV (RMSSD) | 20-80 ms (age-dependent) | < 20 or declining trend |
| Sleep duration | 6.5-8.5 hours | < 5 or > 10 hours |
| Daily steps | 5,000-12,000 | < 3,000 |

### Age and Context Adjustment

**Understanding that:**
- HRV naturally declines with age
- Athletes have lower resting HR
- Sleep needs vary individually
- Activity norms differ by occupation

---

## Module 2: Risk Score Interpretation

### Composite Scoring

**How risk scores are calculated:**
- Multiple biometric inputs
- Weighted by predictive value
- Calibrated against outcomes
- Produces 0-100 score

### Score Categories

| Score | Category | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Low risk, favorable factors |
| 60-79 | Good | Standard risk |
| 40-59 | Average | Monitor, possible concerns |
| 20-39 | Concerning | Elevated risk, review needed |
| 0-19 | High Risk | Significant concern, investigation |

### Score Limitations

**Underwriters should understand:**
- Scores are probability estimates
- Individual variation exists
- Context matters (temporary vs. chronic)
- Scores should inform, not dictate

### When to Override Scores

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Score contradicts clinical evidence | Weight clinical |
| Temporary condition affects metrics | Adjust interpretation |
| Data quality issues | Request more data |
| Edge of threshold | Consider holistically |

---

## Module 3: Pattern Recognition

### Healthy Patterns

**What good data looks like:**
- Consistent daily patterns
- Weekend recovery visible
- Seasonal variation normal
- Gradual improvement over time

### Warning Signs

| Pattern | Possible Indication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Declining HRV trend | Developing stress, cardiac concern |
| Rising resting HR | Declining fitness, illness |
| Sleep deterioration | Health issue, mental health |
| Activity decline | Functional limitation |

### Acute vs. Chronic

| Characteristic | Acute | Chronic |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Duration | Days to weeks | Months |
| Recovery | Returns to baseline | No recovery |
| Pattern | Discrete event | Continuous |
| Underwriting impact | May be temporary | Risk factor |

### Red Flags

**Immediate escalation triggers:**
- Irregular heart rhythm indicators
- Severe HRV depression (< 10 ms)
- Complete activity cessation
- Extreme sleep disruption (< 3 hours)

---

## Module 4: Integration with Traditional Factors

### Biometrics in Context

**Biometric data complements, doesn't replace:**
- Medical history
- Clinical exams
- Lab results
- Prescription records

### Alignment and Contradiction

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Biometrics align with traditional | Increased confidence |
| Biometrics better than expected | Investigate further |
| Biometrics worse than expected | Request clarification |
| Contradiction | Seek reconciliation |

### Weighting Decisions

| Situation | Biometric Weight |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Young, healthy applicant | Higher (less traditional data) |
| Complex medical history | Lower (clinical dominates) |
| Trend data available | Higher (trajectory matters) |
| Limited data duration | Lower (need more observation) |

---

## Module 5: Decision Scenarios

### Case Study 1: The Fit Overweight Applicant

**Traditional data:**
- BMI 32 (obese)
- No diagnosed conditions
- Age 42

**Biometric data:**
- Daily steps: 12,000
- Resting HR: 58 BPM
- HRV: High for age
- Sleep: 7.5 hours, good quality
- Trend: Stable healthy pattern

**Decision:** Metabolically healthy obese—biometrics suggest lower risk than BMI implies. Consider preferred rating despite weight.

### Case Study 2: The Stressed Executive

**Traditional data:**
- Excellent medical history
- No conditions
- Age 48

**Biometric data:**
- Activity: Good (8,000 steps)
- HRV: Low and declining
- Resting HR: Elevated (78 BPM)
- Sleep: Poor quality, 5.5 hours
- Stress indicators: High

**Decision:** Traditional data favorable but biometrics show chronic stress pattern. Standard rating with wellness recommendation.

### Case Study 3: The Recovering Patient

**Traditional data:**
- Recent cardiac event
- Completed rehab
- Age 55

**Biometric data:**
- Activity: Improving trajectory
- HRV: Low but recovering
- Resting HR: Decreasing trend
- Exercise tolerance: Increasing

**Decision:** Biometrics show genuine recovery trajectory. Consider better rating than cardiac history alone would suggest.

**To applicants:**
- Plain language explanation
- Focus on what data showed
- Pathway to improvement if applicable
- Respect privacy

**To agents:**
- Technical but accessible
