## Introduction

Not all wearables are created equal—and not all serve insurance purposes well.

The consumer wearable market offers hundreds of options, but insurance programs have specific requirements: data quality for risk assessment, long-term wearability for sustained engagement, and data access for analytics. A device that's great for fitness enthusiasts may fail for insurance populations.

**This framework helps evaluate and select wearables for insurance programs.**
