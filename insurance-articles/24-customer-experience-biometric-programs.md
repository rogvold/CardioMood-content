## Introduction

The best biometric analytics are worthless if customers don't participate.

Customer experience determines whether members enroll, stay engaged, and ultimately benefit from biometric programs. A clunky enrollment process, confusing app, or invasive-feeling program will fail regardless of the underlying technology.

**This guide covers experience design principles for biometric insurance programs.**

## The Customer Journey

### Journey Stages

| Stage | Member Experience |
|-------|-------------------|
| Awareness | Learning program exists |
| Interest | Evaluating participation |
| Enrollment | Signing up and setup |
| Onboarding | First days with device/app |
| Active use | Daily engagement |
| Sustained participation | Long-term involvement |
| Benefit realization | Seeing value |

### Drop-Off Points

| Stage | Common Drop-Off Reasons |
|-------|------------------------|
| Awareness → Interest | Doesn't seem relevant |
| Interest → Enrollment | Too complicated, privacy concerns |
| Enrollment → Onboarding | Setup difficulties |
| Onboarding → Active | Forgot, didn't form habit |
| Active → Sustained | Lost interest, no perceived value |

## Awareness and Interest

### Value Proposition Communication

**What members want to know:**
- What's in it for me?
- What do I have to do?
- Is my data safe?
- How much time does it take?

**Effective messaging:**

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Lead with benefits | Lead with features |
| Use specific savings/rewards | Use vague promises |
| Address privacy upfront | Hide privacy details |
| Show simplicity | Overwhelm with details |

### Channel Optimization
