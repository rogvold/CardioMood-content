## Introduction

Reinsurance relationships can accelerate or hinder biometric program adoption.

Forward-thinking reinsurers see biometric data as improving risk selection and claims outcomes—potentially offering favorable treaty terms for innovative programs. Traditional reinsurers may view novel data sources with skepticism, requiring additional comfort before providing capacity.

**This guide examines reinsurance considerations for biometric insurance programs.**

---

## Reinsurer Perspectives

### Opportunity View

**Progressive reinsurers see biometric programs as:**
- Better risk selection (lower claims)
- Improved risk monitoring (earlier intervention)
- Portfolio management (better insights)
- Innovation partnership (market differentiation)

### Concern View

**Traditional reinsurers may worry about:**
- Unproven methodology
- Selection effects (are better risks just opting in?)
- Data dependency (what if platform fails?)
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Model risk

### The Middle Ground

Most reinsurers want:
- Evidence of predictive value
- Understanding of methodology
- Data on program performance
- Protection against unknown risks

---

## Treaty Considerations

### Quota Share Implications

**For proportional treaties:**

| Consideration | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| Improved selection | Reinsurer benefits proportionally |
| Premium discounts | Reinsurer receives discounted premium |
| Data sharing | What data does reinsurer receive? |
| Model transparency | Does reinsurer understand methodology? |

### Excess of Loss Considerations

**For non-proportional treaties:**

| Consideration | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| Severity reduction | Fewer large claims (early detection) |
| Frequency reduction | Prevention programs |
| Attachment point | May negotiate lower with better selection |
| Rate | May justify rate reduction |

### Treaty Modifications

**Possible treaty provisions:**

| Provision | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Biometric program endorsement | Define treatment of monitored risks |
| Data sharing clause | Specify what reinsurer receives |
| Reporting requirements | Enhanced performance reporting |
| Rate adjustment mechanism | Credit for demonstrated improvement |

---

## Structuring Options

### Option 1: Program Carve-Out

**Structure:**
- Biometric-monitored risks in separate pool
- Separate treaty or section
- Performance tracked independently
- Rate adjusted based on experience

**Advantages:**
- Clear performance measurement
- Targeted terms
- Innovation recognition

**Disadvantages:**
- Complexity
- Scale limitations initially

### Option 2: Blended Approach

**Structure:**
- Biometric risks in main treaty
- No separate treatment
- Portfolio-level impact
- Performance monitored internally

**Advantages:**
- Simpler
- Immediate capacity
- Lower administrative burden

**Disadvantages:**
- Improvement diluted in portfolio
- Less recognition of innovation
- Harder to negotiate credits

### Option 3: Innovation Partnership

**Structure:**
- Reinsurer as program partner
- Joint development/investment
- Shared data and insights
- Aligned incentives

**Advantages:**
- Deep partnership
- Potential favorable terms
- Reinsurer expertise access
- Risk sharing in development

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires right partner
- Less flexibility
- Dependency

## Reinsurer Due Diligence

### What Reinsurers Will Ask

**Data and methodology:**
- What biometric data is collected?
- How is it used in underwriting?
- What is the predictive model?
- How was it validated?
- What are the limitations?

**Program structure:**
- Who participates (voluntary vs. required)?
- What incentives exist?
- How is data collected and managed?
- What happens if technology fails?

**Performance:**
- What evidence of claims impact exists?
- How long has program operated?
- What is selection effect adjustment?
- How does experience compare to book?

### Providing Comfort

**Evidence to prepare:**

| Type | Content |
|------|---------|
| Validation study | Predictive power demonstration |
| Experience analysis | Claims experience of program |
| Selection adjustment | Addressing opt-in bias |
| Process documentation | How program operates |
| Risk mitigation | What-if scenarios addressed |

---

## Data Sharing Considerations

### What to Share

| Data Type | Sharing Appropriateness |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Aggregate program performance | Yes, appropriate |
| Risk scoring methodology | Summary level |
| Individual risk scores | Possibly, for facultative |
| Raw biometric data | Generally no |
| Program design | Yes |

### Data Protection

**Ensure:**
- Contractual data protection
- De-identification where possible
- Limited use provisions
- Security requirements

### Reporting Format

**Regular reporting might include:**
- Program participation rates
- Claims experience (monitored vs. not)
- Risk score distribution
- Trend analysis
- Intervention effectiveness

---

## Negotiation Strategies

### Positioning the Program

**Frame for reinsurer:**
- Improved risk selection benefits both parties
- Data provides transparency, not uncertainty
- Early intervention reduces severity
- Program aligns incentives (healthy customers = lower claims)

### Timing Considerations

| Stage | Negotiation Position |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pre-launch | Limited leverage, seeking support |
| Early operation | Some data, building credibility |
| Established (2+ years) | Evidence-based negotiation |
| Proven (5+ years) | Strong position for credits |

### Seeking Credits

**Arguments for rate reduction:**
- Demonstrated claims improvement
- Selection improvement
- Early intervention savings
- Competitive pressure

**What to expect:**
- Initial: Recognition, no immediate credit
- Established: 5-10% credit consideration
- Proven: 10-15%+ credit possible
