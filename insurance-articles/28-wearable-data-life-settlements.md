**Alt Text:** Life settlement valuation using wearable biometric data

## Introduction

Life settlements—the sale of existing life insurance policies—depend entirely on life expectancy assessment.

Traditional life settlement underwriting uses medical records, prescription data, and clinical assessments to estimate how long the insured will live. These methods are limited by their point-in-time nature and reliance on documented conditions.

**Wearable biometric data offers continuous health monitoring that can dramatically improve life expectancy accuracy.**

---

## The Life Settlement Valuation Challenge

### How Valuations Work

**Policy value depends on:**
- Face amount of policy
- Premiums required to maintain
- Estimated life expectancy of insured
- Discount rate for time value

**The shorter the life expectancy, the higher the settlement value.**

### Why Accuracy Matters

| Estimation Error | Consequence |
|------------------|------------|
| Overestimate LE | Overpay for policy, poor returns |
| Underestimate LE | Underpay, miss acquisition, insured disadvantaged |
| High uncertainty | Wider pricing spreads, less competitive offers |

**Better life expectancy accuracy = better transactions for all parties.**

### Current Limitations

**Traditional LE assessment relies on:**
- Medical records (historical, incomplete)
- Prescription database (treatment, not health)
- Phone interviews (self-reported)
- Attending physician statements (one-time)

**Missing:** Current health trajectory, daily function, objective vitals.

## How Wearable Data Helps

### Continuous Health Monitoring

| Traditional | Wearable |
|-------------|----------|
| Snapshot medical records | Continuous health stream |
| Reported conditions | Objective measurement |
| Past health events | Current health trajectory |
| Clinical diagnoses | Daily function indicators |

### Relevant Biometric Metrics

| Metric | LE Relevance |
|--------|-------------|
| HRV | Cardiovascular health, autonomic function |
| Resting heart rate | Fitness, cardiac health |
| Activity levels | Functional capacity, mortality predictor |
| Sleep quality | Overall health indicator |
| Trends | Improving vs. declining trajectory |

### Trajectory Over Snapshot

**Example:**
- Medical records show: Controlled diabetes, hypertension
- Traditional LE: Based on average for conditions
- Wearable data shows: Declining HRV, rising RHR, declining activity

**Wearable data reveals health trajectory that records miss.**

---

## Valuation Enhancement

### Improved LE Accuracy

| Approach | LE Accuracy | Confidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Records only | ± 18-24 months | Lower |
| Records + interview | ± 15-20 months | Moderate |
| Records + biometrics | ± 10-15 months | Higher |

### Risk Stratification Refinement

**Within same medical profile:**

| Biometric Profile | LE Adjustment |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Strong biometrics | Longer LE |
| Average biometrics | No adjustment |
| Concerning biometrics | Shorter LE |
| Declining trajectory | LE compression |

### Pricing Impact

**For a $1M policy:**

| LE Difference | Premium Impact | Settlement Value Impact |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 12 months shorter | Lower premiums | $50-100K higher value |
| 12 months longer | Higher premiums | $50-100K lower value |

**Accuracy in LE directly impacts transaction economics.**

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Underwriting Enhancement

**Add biometric data to standard underwriting:**
- Request wearable data from insured
- Integrate with medical underwriting
- Adjust LE based on biometric indicators
- Price accordingly

**Challenge:** Depends on insured cooperation.

### Approach 2: Monitoring Period

**Require monitoring before final pricing:**
- Preliminary offer based on records
- 30-90 day monitoring period
- Final offer after biometric assessment
- Ongoing monitoring optional

**Advantage:** More data, better accuracy.

### Approach 3: Post-Acquisition Monitoring

**Monitor after settlement closes:**
- Acquire policy at market price
- Implement monitoring program
- Refine LE estimates over time
- Adjust portfolio expectations

**Advantage:** Works even without pre-acquisition data.

## Insured Considerations

### Why Insureds Might Participate

| Benefit | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Better offer | More accurate LE may improve offer |
| Faster processing | Objective data speeds decisions |
| Transparency | Understand their own health |
| Optional participation | Choice to share |

### Privacy Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Health disclosure | Clear consent, limited use |
| Data security | Strong protections |
| Third-party sharing | Restricted by agreement |

### Incentive Structures

**Options to encourage participation:**
- Higher offers for data sharing
- Faster processing
- Wellness program access
- Premium payment assistance

---

## Investor Considerations

### Portfolio Valuation

**Wearable data improves portfolio management:**

| Application | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Acquisition pricing | More accurate valuations |
| Portfolio monitoring | Track health trajectories |
| Reserve estimation | Better LE projections |
| Risk management | Earlier intervention signals |

### Due Diligence

**For individual policies:**
- Request wearable data history
- Assess biometric trends
- Compare to medical records
- Adjust LE accordingly

### Portfolio Optimization

**For portfolios:**
- Monitor aggregate health trends
- Identify LE revisions needed
- Adjust reserves as data accumulates
- Improve future acquisition targeting

---

## Case Example

### Traditional Assessment

**Insured profile:**
- 75-year-old male
- Type 2 diabetes, controlled
- History of heart attack (5 years ago)
- No recent hospitalizations
- Current medications: Standard for conditions

**Traditional LE estimate:** 8-10 years

### With Biometric Data

**Wearable data (90 days):**
- Daily steps: 2,500 (low for age)
- Declining trend: -15% over 90 days
- HRV: Low and declining
- Resting HR: Elevated, rising
- Sleep: Poor quality, fragmented

**Biometric-adjusted LE:** 6-7 years

### Valuation Impact

| Factor | Traditional | Biometric-Adjusted |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| LE estimate | 9 years | 6.5 years |
| Premium burden | Higher | Lower |
| Settlement value | Lower | 25-30% higher |

## Challenges

### Data Availability

**Challenge:** Not all insureds have or will share wearable data

**Mitigation:**

**Mitigation:**
- Understand selection dynamics
- Adjust expectations
- Price accordingly

### Technology Evolution
