## Introduction

Critical illness insurance pays lump sums upon diagnosis of specified conditions: heart attack, stroke, cancer, and other major diseases.

The traditional model is purely reactive—wait for diagnosis, pay claim. But many critical illnesses have detectable precursors. Cardiovascular events often follow months of declining health indicators. Some cancers show early warning signs in sleep and activity patterns.

**Biometric monitoring creates opportunities for prevention, not just payment.**

## The Prevention Opportunity

### Critical Illness Claim Profile

| Condition | % of Claims | Prevention Potential |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Cancer | 60-70% | Moderate (some types) |
| Heart attack | 10-15% | High |
| Stroke | 5-10% | High |
| Major organ failure | 5-10% | Moderate |
| Other | 5-10% | Variable |

### The Prevention Window

| Condition | Warning Period | Biometric Indicators |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Heart attack | Weeks to months | HRV decline, HR elevation |
| Stroke | Weeks to months | HRV changes, AFib detection |
| Type 2 diabetes | Years | Activity decline, sleep changes |
| Some cancers | Months | Sleep, activity, weight changes |

---

## Cardiovascular Prevention

### Heart Attack Risk Indicators

**Biometric warning signs:**

| Indicator | Pattern | Lead Time |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| HRV | Progressive decline | 2-4 weeks |
| Resting HR | Elevation | 1-3 weeks |
| Exercise capacity | Declining | Weeks to months |
| Sleep quality | Deterioration | Variable |

### Intervention Approach

| Detection | Intervention | Outcome |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| HRV decline detected | Outreach, medical referral | Preventive treatment |
| Risk threshold crossed | Cardiology consultation | Condition management |
| Acute warning | Urgent care recommendation | Event prevention |

### Evidence Base

**Research shows:**
- 20-30% of heart attacks preceded by detectable HRV decline
- Early intervention can prevent or reduce severity
- Lifestyle modification reduces risk 40-50%

---

## Stroke Prevention

### Stroke Risk Detection

**Biometric indicators:**

| Indicator | Stroke Relevance |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Atrial fibrillation | Major stroke risk factor |
| HRV patterns | Cardiovascular health |
| Sleep apnea indicators | Stroke risk factor |
| Blood pressure proxies | Hypertension risk |

### AFib Detection

**Wearable AFib capabilities:**
- Some devices FDA-cleared for AFib detection
- Irregular rhythm alerts
- Enables anticoagulation for stroke prevention
- 60-70% stroke risk reduction with treatment

### Prevention Protocol

1. **Monitor:** Continuous rhythm tracking
2. **Detect:** Irregular pattern identification
3. **Alert:** Member notification
4. **Refer:** Cardiology evaluation
5. **Treat:** Anticoagulation if appropriate
6. **Prevent:** Stroke avoided

## Cancer Prevention Considerations

### What Biometrics Can Show

**Biometric cancer indicators are less specific but may include:**

| Indicator | Possible Association |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Unexplained weight loss | General cancer indicator |
| Sleep disruption | Possible early indicator |
| Activity decline | Systemic illness |
| Fatigue patterns | Energy depletion |

### Limitations

**Biometrics for cancer:**
- Less specific than cardiovascular
- Many conditions cause similar patterns
- Cannot replace screening
- Best as supportive indicator

### Complementary Approach

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Screening reminders | Age-appropriate cancer screening |
| Risk behavior modification | Smoking, obesity, etc. |
| General health monitoring | Detect decline for evaluation |
| Engagement platform | Health awareness |

---

## Program Design

### Prevention-Focused CI Programs

**Structure:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Biometric monitoring | Continuous risk assessment |
| Risk stratification | Identify highest risk |
| Intervention triggers | Alert thresholds |
| Care navigation | Guide to appropriate care |
| Incentives | Reward prevention behaviors |

### Incentive Alignment

**Align insurer and member interests:**

| Behavior | Incentive |
|----------|-----------|
| Device wear compliance | Premium credit |
| Healthy biometric patterns | Wellness rewards |
| Responding to alerts | Benefit protection |
| Preventive care completion | Coverage enhancement |

### Integration with Coverage

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Alert → Prevention | No claim, reward |
| Alert → Diagnosis | Claim, but early stage |
| No alert → Diagnosis | Standard claim |

## ROI Analysis

### Prevention Economics

**For heart attack prevention:**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average CI payout | $50,000-200,000 |
| Prevention cost | $500-2,000 per member |
| Prevention success rate | 10-20% of events |
| Break-even | 1 in 100-200 prevented |

### Program Economics

| Component | Annual Cost per Member |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Wearable/platform | $100-200 |
| Monitoring/analytics | $50-100 |
| Care navigation | $50-200 |
| Total | $200-500 |

| Prevention Value | Per Event |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Claim avoided | $50,000-200,000 |
| Reduced severity | $25,000-100,000 |

### Expected ROI

**Assumptions:**
- 5% of members at elevated risk
- 20% of elevated risk would have event
- 30% prevention/severity reduction

**Result:** 3:1 to 5:1 ROI for targeted programs
