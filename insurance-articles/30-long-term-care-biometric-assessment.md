## Introduction

Long-term care insurance covers the cost of care when individuals can no longer perform activities of daily living (ADLs). The trigger for benefits is functional incapacity—the inability to independently perform basic tasks like bathing, dressing, or eating.

Traditional LTC assessment relies on clinical evaluations and self-reporting. These methods are subjective, point-in-time, and subject to gaming. Wearable biometrics offer objective, continuous assessment of functional capacity.

**This guide explores biometric approaches to LTC underwriting and claims.**

## The LTC Assessment Challenge

### What LTC Covers

**Benefits typically trigger when insured cannot perform:**
- Bathing
- Dressing
- Eating
- Toileting
- Transferring
- Continence

**Or when cognitive impairment requires supervision.**

### Traditional Assessment Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Subjectivity | Evaluator variability |
| Point-in-time | Misses daily variation |
| Gaming potential | Performance for evaluator |
| Expensive | In-person assessments costly |
| Invasive | Privacy, dignity concerns |
| Delayed | Scheduling, logistics |

---

## Biometric Functional Assessment

### What Wearables Reveal

| Metric | Functional Relevance |
|--------|---------------------|
| Daily activity level | Mobility capacity |
| Movement patterns | Independence indicator |
| Sleep/wake cycles | Self-care ability |
| Activity consistency | Routine maintenance |
| Gait patterns | Fall risk, mobility |
| Circadian rhythm | Cognitive function proxy |

### ADL Proxies

| ADL | Biometric Proxy |
|-----|-----------------|
| Bathing | Morning activity patterns |
| Dressing | Wake-to-active transition |
| Transferring | Movement frequency |
| Toileting | Nighttime activity patterns |
| Eating | Mealtime activity patterns |
| Mobility | Steps, active minutes |

### Objective vs. Subjective

| Assessment Type | Traditional | Biometric |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Data source | Report, observation | Continuous measurement |
| Timing | Scheduled evaluation | 24/7 monitoring |
| Consistency | Evaluator-dependent | Algorithmic |
| Gaming | Possible | Difficult |

---

## Underwriting Applications

### Risk Assessment

**Biometrics reveal functional trajectory:**

| Pattern | Risk Implication |
|---------|-----------------|
| High, stable activity | Lower LTC risk |
| Declining activity trend | Elevated risk |
| Low activity, stable | Higher current risk |
| Irregular patterns | Cognitive concern |

### Underwriting Enhancement

| Traditional Only | With Biometrics |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Self-reported activity | Objective measurement |
| Medical history | Current function |
| Age-based risk | Individual trajectory |
| Family history | Personal patterns |

### Pre-Existing Condition Detection

**Biometrics may reveal:**
- Undisclosed mobility limitations
- Cognitive decline indicators
- Activity inconsistent with reported health
- Trends suggesting developing conditions

---

## Claims Assessment

### Benefit Trigger Verification

**Biometric data supports:**
- Objective functional impairment evidence
- Continuous monitoring of claimed inability
- Detection of recovery or improvement
- Appropriate benefit level determination

### Claims Scenarios

| Scenario | Biometric Evidence |
|----------|-------------------|
| Legitimate claim | Consistent low activity, poor patterns |
| Improving condition | Increasing activity trend |
| Exaggerated claim | Activity inconsistent with claimed impairment |
| Cognitive claim | Disrupted circadian patterns |

### Claims Management

| Application | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| Initial assessment | Supplement clinical evaluation |
| Ongoing monitoring | Track condition trajectory |
| Level of care | Determine appropriate benefits |
| Recovery detection | Identify improvement |

---

## Cognitive Impairment Assessment

### Biometric Cognitive Indicators

| Pattern | Cognitive Association |
|---------|----------------------|
| Circadian disruption | Cognitive decline |
| Nighttime wandering | Dementia indicator |
| Routine breakdown | Executive function |
| Sleep architecture changes | Cognitive health |

### Monitoring Applications

**For cognitive claims:**
- Objective evidence of impairment
- Progression tracking
- Safety monitoring (wandering)
- Care need verification

### Limitations

**Biometrics support but don't replace:**
- Clinical cognitive assessment
- Neuropsychological testing
- Medical diagnosis
- Professional evaluation

---

## Fall Risk and Prevention

### Fall Prediction

**Biometric fall risk indicators:**

| Indicator | Risk Factor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Gait variability | Balance issues |
| Activity decline | Weakness |
| Sleep disruption | Nighttime fall risk |
| Movement patterns | Instability |

### Prevention Value

| Detection | Intervention | Outcome |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Fall risk identified | Prevention program | Fall avoided |
| Gait changes detected | PT referral | Mobility maintained |
| Nighttime risk seen | Environment modification | Safer sleep |

### Claims Impact

- Falls often trigger LTC claims
- Prevention delays benefit trigger
- Reduced severity when falls occur
- Lower overall claims costs

## Program Design

### Underwriting Program

**Structure:**
- 30-60 day monitoring period
- Activity and pattern assessment
- Functional capacity scoring
- Integrated with medical underwriting

### Post-Issue Monitoring

**Options:**
- Voluntary wellness monitoring
- Premium discount for participation
- Continuous assessment
- Early intervention opportunity

### Claims Assessment Program

**Structure:**
- Biometric data collection upon claim
- Supplement clinical evaluation
- Ongoing monitoring during benefits
- Recovery detection

## Privacy and Ethics

### Unique LTC Considerations

| Concern | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Vulnerable population | Enhanced protections |
| Independence value | Respect autonomy |
| Surveillance feeling | Minimal intrusiveness |

1. **Benefit to insured:** Focus on prevention and appropriate care
2. **Transparency:** Clear explanation of monitoring
3. **Consent:** Informed, ongoing consent
4. **Dignity:** Respect for personal autonomy
5. **Fairness:** Consistent application

### Data Protection

| Protection | Implementation |

| Simplicity | High (limited tech ability) |
| Battery life | High (charging challenges) |
| Durability | High (may be rough on device) |
| Accuracy | High (medical decisions) |

### Deployment Considerations
