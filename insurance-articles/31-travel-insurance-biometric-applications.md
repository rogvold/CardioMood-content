## Introduction

Travel insurance protects against trip disruptions, medical emergencies abroad, and adventure mishaps. Traditional travel insurance is priced on destination, duration, and basic demographics.

Wearable biometrics add new dimensions: pre-trip health status, in-trip monitoring, and real-time risk management. This enables personalized pricing, proactive assistance, and smarter claims handling.

**This guide explores biometric applications across the travel insurance lifecycle.**

## Pre-Trip Applications

### Health Risk Assessment

**Traditional approach:**
- Self-declared medical conditions
- Age-based loading
- Generic destination risk

**Biometric-enhanced approach:**
- Objective current health status
- Fitness level for planned activities
- Stress and recovery capacity
- Recent health trajectory

### Fitness for Purpose

| Trip Type | Relevant Biometrics |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Adventure/active | Cardiovascular fitness, activity levels |
| Altitude destinations | HRV, resting HR, recovery |
| Extended travel | Sleep patterns, stress capacity |
| Elderly traveler | Functional capacity, fall risk |

### Pre-Trip Risk Scoring

| Risk Factor | Biometric Indicator |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Cardiac event | Low HRV, elevated RHR |
| Heat intolerance | Poor recovery metrics |
| Altitude sickness | Cardiovascular indicators |
| Fatigue-related issues | Sleep quality, stress |

---

## Pricing Applications

### Dynamic Risk Pricing

**Traditional:**
- Fixed rates by destination
- Age bands
- Pre-existing condition declarations

**Biometric-informed:**
- Individual health assessment
- Activity-appropriate risk
- Trend-adjusted pricing

### Pricing Scenarios

| Scenario | Pricing Adjustment |
|----------|-------------------|
| Fit traveler, adventure trip | Standard to discount |
| Declining metrics, any trip | Consider loading |
| Excellent health, extreme trip | Reduced from base |
| Poor fitness, active trip | Loading or exclusion |

### Incentive Pricing

| Offer | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Healthy traveler discount | Demonstrated good biometrics |
| Pre-trip wellness bonus | Improved metrics before departure |
| Activity tracking discount | Agree to in-trip monitoring |

---

## In-Trip Monitoring

### Real-Time Health Tracking

**Continuous monitoring enables:**
- Early warning of health issues
- Activity verification for claims
- Emergency response coordination
- Location-health integration

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Biometric Application |
|----------|----------------------|
| Altitude sickness | HRV/SpO2 monitoring for early detection |
| Heat exhaustion | Heart rate, activity in heat |
| Cardiac event | Rhythm, HRV alerts |
| Accident/injury | Activity cessation, location |

### Emergency Response

**Biometric-enhanced assistance:**

| Detection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Severe abnormality | Immediate contact attempt |
| No response + alert | Dispatch emergency services |
| Location + vitals | Inform emergency responders |
| Medical history | Share with treating physicians |

---

## Adventure and Sports Coverage

### Activity Verification

**For claims involving:**
- Skiing/snowboarding injuries
- Diving incidents
- Hiking/climbing accidents
- Water sports

**Biometric evidence:**
- Activity patterns confirming participation
- Timing of incident
- Pre-incident health status
- Post-incident condition

### Risk Management

| Activity | Biometric Value |
|----------|----------------|
| High-altitude trekking | Altitude acclimatization tracking |
| Scuba diving | Fitness verification |
| Marathon/events | Training status |
| Extreme sports | Cardiovascular readiness |

### Claims Enhancement

| Claim Type | Biometric Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Activity injury | Activity data confirming participation |
| Medical emergency | Health status leading to event |
| Trip interruption (illness) | Objective health decline |
| Adventure accident | Timeline and context |

---

## Medical Claims Applications

### Claims Verification

**Biometric evidence supports:**
- Timing of illness onset
- Severity of condition
- Pre-trip health status
- Legitimacy of claim

### Pre-Existing Condition Handling

| Situation | Biometric Role |
|-----------|---------------|
| Undeclared condition | May reveal through patterns |
| Stable condition (covered) | Verify stability |
| Condition exacerbation | Distinguish from new issue |
| Claim dispute | Objective evidence |

### Severity Assessment

**Biometrics inform:**
- Was emergency evacuation warranted?
- Duration of incapacity
- Recovery trajectory
- Appropriateness of care level

---

## Trip Cancellation/Interruption

### Pre-Departure Illness

**Biometric evidence for cancellation claims:**
- Objective illness indicators
- Timing relative to departure
- Severity of condition
- Supporting medical necessity

### Interruption Claims

**For illness-based interruption:**
- Health decline during trip
- Severity requiring return
- Timeline of deterioration
- Medical necessity evidence

### Fraud Prevention

**Biometrics help detect:**
- Claimed illness with normal patterns
- Exaggerated severity
- Timing inconsistencies
- Pattern not matching claim
