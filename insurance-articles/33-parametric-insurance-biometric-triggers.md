## Introduction

Parametric insurance pays automatically when predefined conditions are met—no claims process, no adjuster, no waiting. Traditional parametric products trigger on external events like hurricanes or earthquakes.

Biometric data creates the possibility of health-based parametric insurance: automatic payouts triggered by objective health measurements. Hospitalization detected by location and activity patterns. Cardiac events identified by heart rhythm changes. Disability verified by functional decline.

**This article explores the parametric model applied to biometric triggers.**

## Parametric Insurance Explained

### Traditional Parametric Model

**Characteristics:**
- Predefined trigger event
- Objective measurement
- Automatic payout
- No claims investigation
- Fixed benefit amount

**Examples:**
- Hurricane category triggers payout
- Earthquake magnitude triggers payout
- Flight delay duration triggers payout

### Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Speed | Immediate payout upon trigger |
| Certainty | Clear trigger = clear payment |
| Simplicity | No claims process |
| Lower costs | No investigation expense |
| Transparency | Both parties know rules |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Basis risk | Trigger may not match actual loss |
| Moral hazard | Potential for trigger manipulation |
| Limited scope | Not all events have clear triggers |
| Regulatory | Novel structure, regulatory uncertainty |

## Biometric Parametric Triggers

### Possible Trigger Events

| Trigger | Detection Method | Product Application |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Hospitalization | Location + activity pattern | Hospital indemnity |
| Cardiac event | Rhythm + HRV change | Critical illness |
| Surgery | Activity cessation + recovery pattern | Surgical benefit |
| Disability | Functional decline | Disability income |
| Injury | Activity change + location | Accident coverage |

### Trigger Characteristics

**For biometric triggers to work:**

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Objectivity | Measurable, not self-reported |
| Specificity | Clearly indicates event |
| Reliability | Accurate detection |
| Timeliness | Detected when occurs |
| Tamper-resistance | Difficult to fake |

## Product Concepts

### Concept 1: Hospital Indemnity Parametric

**Trigger:** Hospitalization detected by:
- Location at hospital
- Activity pattern (minimal movement)
- Duration threshold (e.g., > 6 hours)

**Payout:**
- Automatic daily benefit
- No claims submission
- Payout within 24 hours

### Concept 2: Cardiac Event Parametric

**Trigger:** Cardiac event detected by:
- Heart rhythm abnormality
- HRV collapse
- Activity cessation
- Confirmed by emergency location

**Payout:**
- Immediate lump sum
- Emergency expense coverage
- No waiting for diagnosis confirmation

### Concept 3: Surgical Recovery Parametric

**Trigger:** Surgery recovery detected by:
- Activity drop below threshold
- Duration of incapacity
- Recovery pattern

**Payout:**
- Daily benefit during recovery
- Graduated based on recovery progress
- Automatic based on patterns

### Concept 4: Functional Disability Parametric

**Trigger:** Functional decline detected by:
- Activity level below threshold
- Duration of impairment
- Pattern indicating disability

**Payout:**
- Income replacement benefit
- Triggered by objective incapacity
- Continues while patterns indicate disability

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: False Positives

**Problem:** Trigger events detected incorrectly

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple confirming signals
- Duration requirements
- Pattern verification
- Opt-in confirmation

### Challenge 2: Moral Hazard

**Problem:** Intentional trigger manipulation

**Mitigation:**
- Complex trigger requirements
- Pattern analysis for anomalies
- Exclusions for self-infliction
- Monitoring for gaming

### Challenge 3: Basis Risk

**Problem:** Trigger doesn't match actual loss

**Example:** Hospitalization detected but for minor issue

**Mitigation:**
- Severity thresholds
- Duration requirements
- Layered triggers
- Supplemental (not replacement) coverage

### Challenge 4: Regulatory Uncertainty

**Problem:** Novel product structure

**Mitigation:**
- Regulatory consultation
- Clear product documentation
- State-by-state assessment
- Industry collaboration on standards

## Hybrid Models

### Parametric Plus Indemnity

**Structure:**
- Parametric: Immediate payment on trigger
- Indemnity: Additional coverage with claims process

**Example:** Hospital event
- Parametric: $500/day automatic on hospitalization detection
- Indemnity: Excess coverage via traditional claims

### Parametric with Verification

**Structure:**
- Immediate partial payout on trigger
- Full payout after light verification
- No traditional claims process

**Example:**
- Cardiac trigger detected → $10,000 immediate
- Medical confirmation → Additional $40,000
- Total $50,000, mostly immediate

### Parametric Prevention

**Structure:**
- Monitor for pre-event patterns
- Alert for intervention opportunity
- Payout if event occurs despite intervention

**Example:**
- Cardiac risk patterns detected → Alert + resources
- Event despite intervention → Full payout
- Prevention success → Wellness reward

## Pricing Considerations

### Trigger Frequency

| Trigger Type | Frequency | Pricing Impact |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Hospitalization | 10-15% annual | Moderate premium |
| Cardiac event | 1-2% annual | Lower frequency, higher severity |
| Disability | 2-5% annual | Moderate |
| Accident | 5-10% annual | Moderate |

### Premium Calculation

**Factors:**
- Trigger probability
- Payout amount
- False positive cost
- Administration (lower than traditional)
- Profit margin

### Competitiveness

**vs. Traditional products:**
- Lower admin cost = lower premium possible
- Speed value = premium tolerance
- Simplicity value = premium tolerance
