## Introduction

Workers' compensation insurance covers injuries and illnesses arising from employment. The most effective strategy for reducing claims isn't better claims handling—it's preventing injuries in the first place.

Biometric monitoring enables real-time workplace safety: detecting fatigue, heat stress, and physical strain before they cause injury. Post-injury, biometrics objectively track recovery and return-to-work readiness.

**This guide covers biometric applications across the workers' comp lifecycle.**

## Prevention Applications

### Fatigue Monitoring

**Fatigue causes 13% of workplace injuries.**

| Fatigue Indicator | Detection Method |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Reduced alertness | HRV patterns |
| Poor recovery | Sleep quality tracking |
| Accumulated stress | Trend analysis |
| Impaired reaction | Circadian disruption |

**Intervention:** Alert workers and supervisors before fatigue-related incidents.

### Heat Stress Prevention

**Heat-related illness is life-threatening.**

| Indicator | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Elevated core temperature | Heart rate elevation |
| Dehydration | HR + activity mismatch |
| Heat exhaustion approach | Combined vital changes |
| Individual risk | Personal heat tolerance |

**Intervention:** Rest, hydration, and cooling before medical emergency.

### Physical Strain Detection

**Musculoskeletal injuries are most common WC claims.**

| Indicator | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Overexertion | Heart rate during physical tasks |
| Poor recovery | Incomplete rest periods |
| Cumulative strain | Trend of elevated exertion |
| Individual capacity | Personal fitness level |

**Intervention:** Modify tasks, rotate workers, ensure rest periods.

### Impairment Detection

**Impairment increases injury risk.**

| Indicator | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fatigue impairment | HRV + activity patterns |
| Medication effects | Pattern changes |
| Illness | Vital sign changes |
| Circadian disruption | Sleep/wake patterns |

| Caution | Elevated risk | Supervisor alert |
| Danger | Imminent risk | Mandatory intervention |
| Emergency | Critical state | Immediate response |

### Integration with Safety Systems

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| Site management | Worker status dashboard |
| Incident response | Automatic dispatch on emergency |
| Safety reporting | Biometric data in safety metrics |
| Training | Target training to at-risk workers |

### Industry Applications

| Industry | Primary Risk | Biometric Application |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Construction | Falls, heat, strain | Fatigue, heat, exertion |
| Manufacturing | Repetitive motion | Strain, fatigue |
| Transportation | Fatigue | Alertness, rest |
| Warehousing | Exertion | Physical strain |
| Mining | Heat, fatigue | Environmental, fatigue |

## Underwriting Applications

### Employer Risk Assessment

**Biometric data reveals workplace health:**

| Metric | Underwriting Value |
|--------|-------------------|
| Population fatigue levels | Risk factor |
| Heat stress incidence | Industry risk |
| Physical strain patterns | Job hazard assessment |
| Safety culture | Intervention response |

### Pricing Factors

| Factor | Traditional | With Biometrics |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Industry class | Standard rates | Individual employer |
| Experience mod | Historical claims | Current conditions |
| Safety programs | Self-reported | Objectively measured |
| Loss control | Periodic visits | Continuous monitoring |

### Experience Modification

**Biometric programs may justify:**
- Lower experience modification
- Premium credits for programs
- Competitive pricing advantage
- Long-term rate improvement

## Claims Applications

### Injury Verification

**Biometric evidence supports:**

| Claim Element | Biometric Evidence |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Timing | Activity patterns at claimed time |
| Mechanism | Exertion levels consistent with injury |
| Pre-injury status | Baseline health |
| Causation | Work-related vs. pre-existing |

### Fraud Detection

**Biometrics help identify:**

| Issue | Detection |
|-------|-----------|
| Fabricated injuries | No supporting biometric change |
| Exaggerated claims | Activity inconsistent with claimed disability |
| Pre-existing conditions | Patterns before incident |
| Malingering | Recovery inconsistent with biometrics |

### Claims Management

| Application | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Initial assessment | Objective injury evidence |
| Treatment monitoring | Track progress |
| Modified duty | Verify capability |
| RTW readiness | Objective capacity assessment |

---

## Return to Work

### Recovery Monitoring

**Biometrics track:**
- Activity tolerance improvement
- Physical capacity progression
- Sleep and recovery quality
- Stress and pain indicators

### Modified Duty Assessment

| Assessment | Biometric Role |
|------------|---------------|
| Capacity | Objective functional level |
| Restrictions | Activity limits |
| Progress | Improvement tracking |
| Full duty readiness | Capacity verification |

### RTW Milestones

| Milestone | Biometric Indicator |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Light duty capability | Minimal activity tolerance |
| Modified work | Moderate activity sustained |
| Full duty assessment | Normal patterns restored |
| Sustained recovery | Stable capacity over time |

### Reinjury Prevention

| Risk Factor | Monitoring |
|-------------|-----------|
| Premature return | Capacity vs. demands |
| Overexertion | Physical strain during RTW |
| Incomplete recovery | Trend analysis |
| Accommodation effectiveness | Activity with modifications |
