## Introduction

Telemedicine adoption accelerated dramatically and is now a permanent feature of healthcare. Insurance has adapted to cover virtual visits, but the integration often stops there.

Biometric data creates a bridge between telemedicine and insurance: providing clinical context for virtual visits, enabling remote patient monitoring, and informing both care decisions and coverage.

**This guide explores integration of biometrics across telemedicine and insurance.**

## The Integration Opportunity

### Current State

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Telemedicine coverage | Broadly covered |
| Remote monitoring | Emerging coverage |

| Care coordination | Siloed often |
| Claims automation | Minimal |

### The Biometric Bridge

**Wearable data connects:**
- Patient → Telemedicine provider → Insurer
- Continuous context for virtual visits
- Objective data for remote care
- Evidence for coverage decisions

                              → Specialist
```

### Coordination Benefits

| Stakeholder | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Patient | Continuous care, less repetition |
| Telehealth provider | Context for virtual visits |
| PCP | Informed about virtual care |
| Insurer | Visibility into care process |
| Care manager | Comprehensive view |

### Consent Framework

**Data sharing requires:**
- Member consent
- Provider opt-in
- Clear data flows
- Privacy protection
- Access controls
