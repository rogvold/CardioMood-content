## Introduction

Insurers increasingly use data to improve underwriting. But not all data can be used equally.

Genetic data—information about inherited DNA—faces significant legal restrictions under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and state laws. Biometric data—measurements of current physiological function—faces no such categorical restrictions.

**Understanding this distinction is critical for compliant, innovative underwriting.**

## Defining the Terms

### Genetic Data

**What it includes:**
- DNA test results
- Family medical history (genetic component)
- Genetic conditions
- Carrier status
- Predisposition testing results

**What it reveals:**
- Inherited disease risk
- Carrier status for genetic conditions
- Population ancestry
- Future disease probability

### Biometric Data

**What it includes:**
- Heart rate and patterns
- Heart rate variability
- Sleep measurements
- Activity levels
- Current physiological measurements

**What it reveals:**
- Current health status
- Functional capacity
- Health trajectory
- Lifestyle patterns

### Key Distinction

| Characteristic | Genetic | Biometric |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Nature | Inherited, fixed | Current, changeable |
| Timing | Future risk prediction | Present state measurement |
| Modifiability | Cannot be changed | Can be improved |
| Legal status | Protected | Generally permitted |

---

## Legal Framework

### GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)

**Applies to:**
- Health insurance (Title I)
- Employment (Title II)

**Prohibits:**
- Using genetic information in health insurance underwriting
- Requiring genetic testing for health coverage
- Requesting family history for health insurance

**Does not apply to:**
- Life insurance
- Disability insurance
- Long-term care insurance

### State Laws

**Many states extend GINA-like protections to:**
- Life insurance
- Disability insurance
- Long-term care insurance

**Examples:**
- California: Broad genetic protections
- Florida: Life insurance genetic restrictions
- Multiple states: Expanding protections

### Biometric Data Legal Status

**No categorical prohibition:**
- Health insurance can use biometric data
- Life insurance can use biometric data
- Disability/LTC can use biometric data
- General privacy laws still apply (HIPAA, state laws)

## Practical Implications

### What Insurers CAN Do

| Data Type | Health Insurance | Life/Disability/LTC |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| HRV | ✓ Use | ✓ Use |
| Heart rate | ✓ Use | ✓ Use |
| Activity | ✓ Use | ✓ Use |
| Sleep | ✓ Use | ✓ Use |
| Genetic test results | ✗ Cannot use | State-dependent |
| Family history | ✗ Genetic component restricted | State-dependent |

### What Biometric Data Cannot Reveal

**Biometrics don't show:**
- Inherited genetic mutations
- Carrier status for genetic conditions
- Ancestry-based disease risk
- Genetic predispositions

**If it can't be revealed by genetics, no GINA issue.**

---

## Why the Distinction Matters

### Policy Rationale

**Genetic data concerns:**
- Immutable (can't be changed)
- Predictive of future disease
- May discourage beneficial testing
- Historical discrimination concerns
- Not individually earned/chosen

**Biometric data differences:**
- Current state (can be improved)
- Reflects lifestyle choices
- Encourages healthy behavior
- No discrimination history
- Individual agency in modification

### Practical Result

| Approach | Legal | Appropriate |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| HRV-based underwriting | ✓ | ✓ |
| Activity-based pricing | ✓ | ✓ |
| Sleep quality assessment | ✓ | ✓ |
| Genetic testing requirement | ✗ (health) | ✗ |
| Family history requirement | ✗ (health) | State-dependent |

## Compliance Guidelines

### For Health Insurance

**Safe biometric uses:**
- Wellness program engagement
- Post-issue health monitoring
- Prevention program targeting
- Claims management

**Prohibited genetic uses:**
- Genetic testing for underwriting
- Family history requirements
- Genetic counseling requirements
- Discrimination based on genetic information

### For Life Insurance

**Biometric data:**
- Generally permitted
- Subject to state insurance regulations
- Must be actuarially justified
- Non-discriminatory application

**Genetic data:**
- GINA doesn't apply
- State laws vary
- Check jurisdiction-specific rules
- Document actuarial basis

### For All Lines

**Best practices:**
- Know what data you're collecting
- Understand what data reveals
- Ensure proper consent
- Document compliance
- Monitor legal developments

---

## Technical Considerations

### Data Separation

| Consideration | Approach |
|--------------|----------|
| Genetic data | Separate systems, strict access |
| Biometric data | Integrated with underwriting |
| Mixing concern | Ensure biometrics don't proxy genetics |

### Genetic Proxies

**Concern:** Biometric patterns that correlate with genetic conditions

**Examples:**
- Certain HRV patterns linked to genetic cardiac conditions
- Activity patterns indicating inherited conditions

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on modifiable factors
- Avoid using biometrics as genetic proxy
- Document actuarial basis for factors used
- Legal review of edge cases

---

## Future Considerations

### Expanding Protections

**Trend:** More states protecting genetic data across insurance lines

**Implications:**
- Monitor legislative developments
- Design for compliance flexibility
- Document data use carefully
- Build separation capabilities

### Converging Data

**Challenge:** As biometric analysis improves, risk of inferring genetic information

**Response:**
- Focus on changeable factors
- Avoid ancestry-related patterns
- Design algorithms with compliance in mind
- Regular legal review

### Consumer Expectations

**Trend:** Growing awareness and concern about genetic data use

**Response:**
- Transparency about data use
- Clear distinction in communication
- Emphasize biometric benefits (improvable)
- Build trust through compliance

## Underwriting Guidance

### Compliant Biometric Underwriting

1. **Use current physiological data:** HRV, HR, sleep, activity
2. **Focus on modifiable factors:** Lifestyle, fitness, recovery
3. **Establish personal baselines:** Individual trends
4. **Document actuarial basis:** Predictive validity
5. **Apply consistently:** Non-discriminatory
6. **Obtain proper consent:** Data collection authorization

### What to Avoid

1. **Family health history:** Genetic component restricted (health)
2. **Genetic test requirements:** Never for health, state-specific elsewhere
3. **Ancestry-based factors:** Genetic proxy risk
4. **Immutable characteristics:** Focus on changeable
5. **Unvalidated correlations:** Ensure actuarial support

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Genetic data is protected:** GINA applies to health insurance
2. **Biometric data is different:** Current, changeable, generally permitted
3. **Distinction is clear:** Inherited vs. current physiological
4. **State laws vary:** Especially for life/disability/LTC
5. **Proxy risk exists:** Avoid using biometrics to infer genetics
6. **Compliance requires care:** Design for legal compliance
7. **Trends favor protection:** Expect expanding genetic restrictions
8. **Biometrics remain opportunity:** Valuable, legal, improvable
