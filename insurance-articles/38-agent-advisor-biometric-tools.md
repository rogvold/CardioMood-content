## Introduction

Agents and advisors are the front line of insurance distribution. They explain products, gather information, and guide clients through underwriting. Biometric data can transform these interactions.

Instead of lengthy questionnaires about exercise habits, clients can share objective data. Instead of waiting weeks for underwriting, decisions can come faster. Instead of guessing about health, advisors can have informed conversations.

**This guide shows how biometric tools empower agents and advisors.**
